The U.S. is involved in a deadly struggle with China in frozen, mountainous terrain.

When I read the back cover for this book and saw a \\"movie-loving heroine\\" I knew I had to read this book.  After the first couple of pages I was laughing hysterically!  Pheobe was someone who I could relate to in every way-she's my favorite chick lit heroine.  The author makes all of her characters very real-I could picture my friends in each of the characters.  It is a Christian novel, but it's not overly preachy or cheesy, which drew me in even more.  It was lots of fun to read and I can't wait to read more from Ms. Walker!  Keep up the great writing!	2005-09-30

What makes it so appealing to me is that (1)It is obviously a labor of love. It's a kind of love that, at the risk of being called \\"sentimental\\" or \\"gushy\\" (as another reviewer called it), Lingerman is totally honest and open in expressing. (2) Lingerman is undoubtedly deeply devoted to music and also to serving both God and mankind.<br /><br />The other two reviewers criticized the author for mainly focusing on two types of music -- Classical and New Age and I know from experience that, in general, these are the most positive or healing types, especially Classical.<br /><br />Because it has to do with resonance, whether or not music is healing has a lot to do with the listener. In his book, \\"The Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism\\", Lama Govinda writes:<br /><br />\\"The true power of mantra...consists mainly in the purity and truthfulness of the speaker....Though the inner attitude of the speaker is the main source of power, yet the form in which it is expressed is not irrelevant. It must be adequate to the spiritual content, melodious, forceful, and supported by mental and emotional associations, created either by tradition or personal experience\\".<br /><br />Though Lama Govinda is speaking of mantra, what he is saying also applies to music in general. If one understands what a mantra is and studies the structure of Beethoven's wonderful Fifth Symphony, he can see that it is based on the extended repetition of one motif or mantra.<br /><br />However, I do not believe that Beehoven's Fifth and other great works of Classical Music are, in and of themselves, healing. In order for a piece of music to be healing or empowering, the listener also needs to be, in Lama Govinda's words, \\"pure\\" and \\"true\\" or able to resonate in tune with the music. For example: If two equally pure Quartz crystal glasses are placed side by side, when one is struck, the other will vibrate or resonate in sympathy with it. If however, the second vessel is made of common glass, it will not vibrate in tune with the crystal glass.<br /><br />My point is that, whether or not music is healing depends to a large extent on the resonance and receptivity of the listener. One of the rules seems to be: \\"Different strokes for different folks\\".<br /><br />For example, I can listen to a recording of a great piece of Classical Music and to Carmen McRae's inimitable recording of \\"Here's That Rainy Day\\" and be moved to tears by both.<br /><br />I am also easily wooed by some of the music of the Beatles, James Taylor and Simon & Garfunkel (to mention only a few) but, as far as healing and transformation are concerned, there's nothing in all the lower musical realms that can compare to a great Classical composition, such as the final movement of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 3 (Jascha Horenstein's performance)<br /><br />I also believe that Classical Music and the very best New Age Music (some of which is listed in this book)has more healing and transformative potential than most other forms.<br /><br />Lingerman focuses primarily on Classical Music, because the great works in that genre , in Lama Govinda's words, are all \\"...adequate to the spiritual content, melodious, forceful, and supported by mental and emotional associations, created either by tradition or personal experience\\".<br /><br />If you don't believe me, purchase this wonderful guide, along with some of the music that Lingerman recommends; follow his clear and simple instructions for how to use an appreciate it and find out for yourself.<br /><br />I'd like to mention just two more things...<br /><br />I think that, by neglecting other types of music, specifically Jazz, Lingerman was expressing preference rather than prejudice. He does mention that Rock may be harmful and there is a mounting body of evidence to show that he is correct. For some insights into what types of music can be harmful or healthy, I'd start with \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\".<br /><br />Lastly, many of the Classical pieces that Lingerman recommends are now available in downloadable file form. If they aren't already available from amazon.com, they soon will be. I predict that, within one year or less, many of the New Age recordings that Lingerman recommends will also be available in this format.<br /><br />OM Shanti (for those of you who don't already know what it is --that's a mantra).

That was two years ago, and I have read the book three times since. Interestingly, it does not read like a self help book, promising miracles after following a few simple steps. It describes the millionaire population in America- who they are, what they do, and the characteristics and habits that they all share. The book does not explain how to make money, rather, you get an idea of what it takes to become a millionaire, even if you have an average income.	2005-09-15

I still regard it as one of the most influential books in my life.  I understand the essays in this small book to be a critical examination of various scientific philosophies.  However what I found to be most illuminating was Bronowski's study of values in a scientist's search for truth; how the values necessary to enable the search for scientific truth in the cooperative enterprise of science are human values ratified by the great religions of the world.  What this meant to me as a callow (at that time) intellectual who was more of an agnostic than an atheist at that point in my life was that many of the value systems espoused and shared by the great religions were independently derivable by the values necessary to succeed in the quest for \\"truth.\\"  This resonanted with me personally more than any thundering proselytizer in a church pulpit and my faith began to grow.  This is a small book to have such a large effect and it is worth reading for many reasons - some well elaborated by other reviewers.  I think Dr. Bronowski would be pleased with its effect on me.	2005-09-23

They are book-ended by classically-driven pieces [i.e., the Odyssey] as well as Renaissance works [Dante]. Hirsch brings his own personal experiences to these renowned works and coopts their voices. The middle sections do not work as well, as they  are \\"personal,\\" or adopt the guise of so being; and they somehow do not hang together cleanly. There are some good pieces, however, like the concentration camp art of children, but the very confessional nature of them is not as strong as the less personal beginning and ending poems.	2005-10-13
