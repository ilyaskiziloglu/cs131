I am using the shuf -n command instead of the RANDOM library (-n means the number of random lines sampled is dependent on user input.)
Therefore, the number and contents of lines sampled is dependent on the user's inputs and when the command is run.
Nevertheless, I have a copy of a run here where -n is 10.

This book was easy to read and the material was presented in a very organized manner.  I use a lot of examples and they actually work (unlike some of the other books that I had purchased).  Great Book !	2000-11-02

Ray Longknife, part of the winning team, killed the unity Party's President. As a reward for his bravery, Ray is now Wardhaven's Minister of Science and Technology. In a further ironic twist, Ray married the woman who crippled him during the war. They expect their first child soon.<br /><br />On a routine diplomatic mission, Ray's spaceship is sabotaged and he and the crew end up leaping into an uncharted galaxy. They land on the nearest habitable planet, which the inhabitants of the lost Santa Maria spaceship have colonized. When the spacers land, they upset the social dynamics leading to strange happenings. They learn that the colonists shared a planet for over three hundred years with an unknown being, who can change the molecular structure of their brains. When warfare seems imminent, Ray and his soldiers implement a battle plan that will either destroy the planet or return it to humanity.<br /><br />THEY ALSO SERVE is populated with characters that seem to live in any neighborhood, which makes it easy to care what happens to the cast as they move from one trauma to another crisis. The fast-paced story line is filled with action, but author Mike Moscoe changes the pace occasionally with thought-provoking concept that impels the reader to reflect for a moment. Mr. Moscoe provides the audience with a powerful military science fiction.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2001-01-09

Unfortunately, I could not find them even though I painstakingly followed the alphabetical order. <BR>After asking someone the meanings, I then did a reverse search from the english section, and found &quot;wait&quot; is something completely different because it is apparently modified as a verb.<br />So the editor should have put all these words in (even if it takes effort) and with the annotation &quot;see...&quot;. This is what good English dictionaries do. eg. waited<br />Otherwise, there should have been some explanation as to how to search in the hebrew section, for a word.<BR>Interestingly, the book cover blurb claims to cover hebrew grammar etc - not true.<br />I am going to buy the Zilberman because my teacher has it too. Until then, I shall use the free Morfix online dictionary. You can find it by entering the keywords Milon and Morfix in any search engine. Click on the first hyperlink to bring up the hebrew keyboard to input your word. However the server is often down or very slow.<BR>I returned this book to the store.	2004-01-31

Taught me a lot, too, but as I've decided I want more creative control, I am moving to writing novels.<br />Book covers several hot scripts which later became successful movies . . . WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, SEVEN, THE PLAYER, IN THE LINE OF FIRE, THE LAST ACTION HERO and WATERWORLD . . . each came in to the hands of powerful Hollywood people by different routes.  <br />More importantly, readers get the opinions of inside screenwriters and producers about marketable scripts.  Something you almost will never find in the basic novels on screenwriting by Syd Field or Michael Hague.<br />Get it, read it and, if you still want to do it, go to WORDPLAYER.COM, which is run by two working pros who graciously give out their information for free.  Things you wouldn't know unless you knew writers in the industry or started working in it for several years.<br />Good luck!	2001-04-07

I like the shabby chic look, and I love looking at the photos in the book, and I would even buy the other books in the series.  But like Martha Stewart, Rachel is trying to make this all about HER. ...where does one find flea markets of this caliber?  Most flea markets around here (Kansas City) sell beanie babies, fake Tommy  Hilfiger, and overpriced figurines.  Flea markets are becoming increasinly  expensive, as vendors who have no idea what they're selling put marked-up  prices on their trash.  Sorry, but I can't afford a trip to Paris to  scavenge for furniture.  <br />Buy the book for the photos and ideas, but  don't expect to cheaply duplicate her look, and don't say I didn't warn you  that you'd get sick of Rachel-this and Rachel-that.	2000-06-05

All Written in 1st Person!!	I bought this book (paperback)in Seattle, WA a few years at a half price book store.  I LOVED IT and after reading all the stories, I sold it back to the book store!!! B-U-T I didn't realize just how unique it was and have been trying to locate a copy of it ever since!!  All the stories are classics and ironically, the publisher compiled them such that all are written in first person, which normally I would avoid.  HOWEVER, THIS ANTHOLOGY OF STORIES TRANSPORTS YOU IMMEDIATELY INTO THE AUTHORS' WORLD OF ADVENTURE AND YOU NEVER WANT TO LEAVE!!  EXCELLENT READING FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!	2004-11-23

I read it in 9 hours on 1 day, open the book and is simple read the firts pages, and then its hard to close the book.  I like Yargo because its a magic world with a  high price to pay, it is a world without emotions that is the Price, that  is a perfect world, and then I appreciated this my real world, because I  can have my own emotions, I can love everyone and the price is a NOT  PERFECT WORLD but everyday can handle it, with a lot of love can handle it.
