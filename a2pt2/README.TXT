This folder was created after the entire folder I had for A2 was lost on 3/12/2023. I was just doing some cleanupwork on the history file when 
I had finished and committed to github. When I pushed, I found that, over the weekend when I had been practicing, I had accidentally added the large 
amazon TSV to one of the folders that I was trying to commit to github. I then removed it and tried again. However, I was now ahead of the "master" branch
on github. In trying to rectify this, I pulled from github at one point and totally reset my environment. Despite that I had committed a few times after the 
original mistake (all had failed the push), all of my work was now gone. I spent over 2 hours trying to fix the issue by merging/creating new branches/trying
to find a dangling commit that I could reference off of but only seemed to make the problem worse. At the end, I lost both A1 and A2.

I plan on reviewing what happened and why it happened with the professor during office hours. I do not know if/how he will try to recover them so I have left 
file names different so as not to cause any problems if they are recovered. For this assignment, the "reference" log is just a reference to go over the 
commands I put in, it does not contain cleaned commands for this submission. 

This file is created for the grader's reference to understand why some of the assignment names may not match 1-1 with what the professor asks for. If you 
would like to know more detail, I am more than happy to discuss as I spent an extensive amount of time on this assignment. Thank you for your understanding.
