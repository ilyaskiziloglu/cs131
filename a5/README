The files for submission for a5 are all in the a5 submission folder. The files in that folder can generally 
be broken up along one of a few different lines: intermediate/development files, finalized files, and 
finalized scripts. For example: 

awk...script.awk files were used to obtain either intermediate or finalized files. 
combinedcountieslayoff contains the final three columns (county, # laid off, zipcode)
numlayoff, layoffpluszip, zipcode, counties, for example, all contaion what their names suggest

Ultimately, the cmds.log file can be used to get a good understanding of the steps taken for the submission.
