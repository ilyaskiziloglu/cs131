At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.	2005-10-14

There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />	2005-10-14

Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

They kill their prey when they feed, so for me they have no redeeming graces no matter how polite, handsome, sexy, etc that they are.  I really did not want to read more than the first few pages, but since I spent so much money on this very short novella, I thought I could probably stand to finish it.  I found the writing less than spectacular also.  The descriptions and scenes seemed to be written in an amateur fashion, so I could not think of the characters as \\"real.\\"  The two main characters fell in love so quickly that I had to read the page again to be sure I had gotten it correct.  Nia was ready for Seth to make a move on her before he even came in the door.  Others may like this sort of approach, but I need some buildup for the relationship to ring true.  While I did like the mixed race content, the rest of it left me cold.  Killer vampires are just not my cup of tea and I could care less if they meet their mates and live happily ever after.  Just think of how many people over the centuries had their lives cut short so that these vampires could continue their existence. Even Nia's friend Imani is killed in the first three pages of the story.  What more can I say.	2005-10-14

For example, the human mind is excellent at recognizing patterns in things...to such a degree that we find many patterns in things which are actually random.  Another bias is the basic tendency to be accepting of evidence which is consistent with our belief but subjecting contradictory evidence to more careful scrutiny.  I have heard the explanation that chronic gamblers tend to relive their wins and block out their losses.  In actual fact, they dwell on the losses a lot more than the wins.  If so, why do they continue not only to gamble, but believe that they are better at it than they really are?  The answer is that their wins are almost always viewed as due to talent and many of the losses are re-categorized as \\"near wins.\\" (\\"If not for that field goal in the last seconds of the game, I would have won\\"--much more so than the corresponding \\"I almost lost that one, but they kicked a field goal at the end of the game and saved it for me.\\")  The first 125 pages cover six different types of bias (and variations of them). <br /> <br />The last third of the book analyzes three cases (alternative medicine, social interaction strategies, & ESP) where there is a lot of belief which is not supported by evidence.  These help a lot in making the ideas from the first part more concrete.	2005-10-14

As a physician and early American history buff I was really looking forward to learning more about Benjamin Rush.<br /><br />In general it seems that the author, despite putting out what appears to be a finished, presentable biography, never really dug into source materials to find out who Benjamin Rush was and why he was important.  Repeatedly, we hear of Rush's fame and accomplishments and influence, but the details are missing.<br /><br />We hear what a great doctor Rush was, considered the preeminent physician of his times, according to the author, but all the author writes about is how Rush tortured his patients with medical treatments we now know are harmful, such as bloodletting, giving cathartics, etc.  Rush is known as the \\"Father of American Psychiatry\\", his book on psychiatry was bible for many many years, and his observations on mental illness were in many ways way way ahead of his times...yet not a word of this is mentioned except in the last ten pages of this 365 page book.  This subject desperately needed to explained.  This is why he is important for heaven's sake.<br /><br />Furthermore, I think it would have been fascinating to have gotten a better feel for what bloodletting and giving cathartics was about, we needed some good old source material, firsthand observations and then-current thoughts, as well as an expose of the tools employed, etc.  Rush, it is clear, considered himself first and foremost and physician.  He dedicated his life to the practice of medicine, he was considered a top academic lecturer.  We are told all the top American physicians for the next half century were either disciples of Rush or disciples of his students.....but we don't really get a feeling for why.<br /><br />His political contributions and inolvement were similarly neglected.  Although he wasn't the political calibre of Hamilton or Jefferson, he was definitely a major player.  Much of the earlier portion of the biography seemed to focus on explaining the political events occurring around Rush during the fight for independence.  The focus should have been Rush.  There's a lot of negativity surrounding Rush early on in the book, but how he seems to know all the important figures in the Revolution and why they respect him is not explained.<br /><br />There also weren't any pictures or illustrations.  I could go on.  On the bright side, at least the book reads well.  If you want to learn more about Rush, you should probably choose another book.  Sorry.	2005-10-14

This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to grow spiritually, who wants to live a conscious and compassionate life, and who wants to contribute to world peace. I have read many books on the topic of vegetarianism, animal rights and animal welfare,  spiritual growth, and peace and nonviolence. This book stands alone in its ability to make the connection between all of these subjects. <br /> <br />Will Tuttle, Ph.D. is a rare combination of extraordinary compassion, scholarly research and education, spiritual commitment and wisdom, intuitive insights, and the courage to challenge a worldview which goes back 10,000 years <br />  <br />In this book, Tuttle explores humanity's relationship with the foods we eat.  He points out, very convincingly, that when humans began herding animals, it began to create a consciousness of exploitation which then spread to the control and domination of other humans, as well as animals.  So the roots of human's violence to humans are found in the practice of seeing animals as objects to exploit for our own purposes: for food, furs, labor, entertainment, \\"sport\\" and experimentation. The use of humans as slaves and the subjugation of women followed the subjugation and enslavement of animals. <br /> <br />One thing that sets this book apart from any of the others that describe the problems associated with a meat-based diet is the focus on the spiritual aspects of our diet.  When we take food into our bodies, we are also ingesting the energy contained in this food. Animals that are tortured and filled with terror and agony as they are killed are filled with this very negative energy.  When humans eat their flesh, we are also ingesting this fear and anger. This affects us deeply.  We cannot live with peace in our hearts as long as we are filling our bodies with the pain and suffering of other beings. <br />   <br />Tuttle helps us to see that none of us have actually chosen a diet based upon meat. Our mothers fed us meat from our infancy.As we got old enough to understand that we were eating animals, we were told that animals were put here for us to eat, so it was okay.  We didn't question this, any more than we questioned wearing clothes or taking baths. Thus, we absorbed the acceptance of exploitation of animals so naturally that we didn't know it was happening.  And being unconscious, it is hard to recognize the violence that is part of our everyday lives through the eating of animals.  Therefore, it is also hard to recognize how insensitive we have become to violence, because we have to protect ourselves from an awareness of the violence we are part of 3 times a day.   <br />  <br />This is a very important book for everyone who wants their lives to contribute to more peace in the world, rather than more suffering and violence.  <br />  <br />	2005-10-14

He could be considered a living national treasure, and I feel fortunate to be alive as his contemporary.  His body of work is enormous, his influence immeasurable; his importance cannot be overstated. <br /> <br />Don't be put off by the copyright date of this book, which is 1971 (despite what the information states, this is probably a third edition of the book, but I believe all three editions are identical aside from the cover).  The material is relevent and perennial.  Historical Japan has not changed, and Keene's insights are every bit as valid now as they were when they were set down on paper (most of the material in this book actually predates the 1971 copyright).  The suggested reading list at the back of the book is a superb springboard for further study, should a certain topic particularly amuse the reader, and the listed volumes are also excellent and continue to be highly relevent. <br /> <br />While a new edition is well-purchased at $22, an older edition can be had cheaply.  I personally own the second edition and am quite pleased with it.  I actually find myself here looking for a hardbound version, but, as one does not exist, I must make do with asserting my heartfelt opinion for this volume. <br /> <br />Basically amounting to an Anthology of Keene of sorts, a collection of some of his writings on Japan, it's an invaluable text.  Were I to teach a general class in Japanese culture, this would surely be a book to include; perhaps it would be the only book necessary.  Infinitely readable, inspirational, interesting, and difficult to put down, I couldn't recommend it more highly.   <br /> <br />If my contributions to the study of Japan and the bridging of cultures amount to even a percentage of Keene's, my life will have been quite a productive one. <br /> <br />Another option to pursue is another collection of Keene's writings called, \\"The Blue-Eyed Taroukaja,\\" and its copyright is much more recent.  It's also highly recommended alongside this one.	2005-10-14

US	52118148	R2ZWUHBLJGPTX9	0465046754	692787574	The Republican War on Science	Books	5	51	61	N	Y	Read this book to understand how far we have descended	In the middle of the 2004 presidential election campaign a report released by the Union of Concerned Scientists, endorsed by thousands of respected academics, accused the Bush administration of an unprecedented pattern of distortion and censorship of important scientific evidence. In typical fashion, the administration responded only when the UCS report gained media attention, and then only to dismiss it as a partisan attack from the left. <br /> <br />Chris Mooney's book documents in plain and incontrovertible fashion why the UCS report was not only non-partisan truth, but significantly understated the case. The current political abuse of science is only the culmination of a consistent strategy fostered by a \\"hard right\\" alliance of corporate and religious conservatives that has gained control of the Republican party since the 1960's. <br /> <br />Corporate attacks on science started with tobacco industry efforts to undermine studies on the health effects of smoking and second-hand smoke. The pattern laid down by the tobacco industry has been consistently followed since: the terms \\"sound science\\" and \\"junk science\\", meaningless in any scientific sense, originated with tobacco lawsuits and have been parlayed by conservatives into codewords for science that respectively supports or threatens \\"conservative\\" ideology. <br /> <br />Mooney categorizes the attacks on science as falling into two main categories. The first of these is an undermining of the processes of science by suppression of information, targeting individual scientists (many of whom work for the government or rely on government grants), or rigging review and advisory committees. The second form these right-wing attacks take is through the communication process to the public after reports are released. This includes \\"spinning\\" the science through misrepresentations or distortions, magnifying uncertainty, relying on and promoting fringe scientists and \\"contrarians\\", and putting scientific clothing on \\"values\\" and ideology. <br /> <br />\\"Manufacturing uncertainty\\" was a key to the tobacco industry strategy that has been repeated again and again on issues from global warming to evolution.  Finding a token scientist to magnify \\"contrarian\\" claims isn't hard: science's health comes from the weathering of constant attacks by those who choose to think differently. But sadly there are also too many scientists willing to distort their own research to conform to the ideologies of funding sources, and a disturbing number of government scientists working for regulatory agencies have been encouraged to alter conclusions of their reports. Mooney notes the sharp distinction in conclusions on the effects of second-hand smoke between industry-funded and independent scientists. <br /> <br />It is one thing to argue and make political decisions based on all the best facts available. That's what we expect our leaders to do. But the right wing attack on science is not satisifed with the facts as they are on the environemnt, biology or medicine. Rather they seek to distort those facts, imposing ideology at an earlier stage, so that decision makers and the public don't even have the truth available to them to make good decisions. <br /> <br />Many of the \\"contrarian\\" scientists who have been selected by the Bush administration to sit on major oversight and advisory panels have very little research background at all. Unfortunately, science's ivory tower makes it far too easy to \\"play scientist\\" for the public - there are no external credentialing mechanisms that effectively separate real experts from impostors. Tellingly, for these political hacks the arguments change with time as the facts on the ground become increasingly inconvenient to their ideology. Denial of global warming becomes denial of human causation, now morphing into assertion that global warming will be good for us. Creationism becomes \\"intelligent design\\". <br /> <br />The broad range of regulatory and scientific areas where the same anti-science tactics have been used forces the conclusion that this is more than separate isolated incidents. Similar issues with failed intelligence on 9-11 and Iraq's WMD, and other apparent efforts to conceal the facts on the ground by the administration imply this pattern of ideological decision making extends far beyond  the areas where science is the central source of facts. <br /> <br />There are examples of liberal science abuse too, where individuals are tempted to spin the facts to fit their ideology. Mooney cites a few cases, but the only systematic pattern seems to be one of exaggeration of direct effects and perhaps denial of uncertainty. Of the examples in question, almost all show liberal statements to be much closer to the scientific facts than the right-wing spin on the same issues. Even so, neither side should try to twist science to their benefit, and to his credit Mooney does criticize both. <br /> <br />The book has a few flaws: there are occasional jarring repetitions of previous arguments that suggest chapters were rewritten several times in mid-stream, without reconsidering the book as a whole. Mooney also seems reluctant to state as baldly as possible what's going on here: some people are lying about the facts, and as a result, other people are dying needlessly. Isn't there legal recourse for such fraud, as happened in the case of tobacco? <br /> <br />Mooney makes a number of sensible suggestions beyond legal action: reinstate the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, pass legislation to bar political litmus tests for committees, roll back the \\"sound science\\" regulatory reform that has done so much harm. More skepticism and understanding of the processes of science from journalists would be a big help, as would some reforms in the science community itself.  But as he also points out, significant change will be impossible in our democracy as long as the current ideologues hold all the strings of power. Getting the information out somehow and persuading the public to vote for moderates instead of ideologues is the most important thing we can do - will it be enough?	2005-10-14

This is actually too soon for this review to be written -- I've only been pursuing the stretches (exercises) for a little over a month now.<br /><br />  On the plus side, I believe I can credit this book with helping me get through the last week or so -- in addition to a cold, I ended up dealing with back, leg, and shoulder problems after a day of tree cutting and trimming, another day of construction work on the house, and a third day of helping our grown children prepare their pool for winter storage, which included letting cold water run over my feet for two hours.  I've suffered from short hamstrings for most of my life, a condition that was finally diagnosed just last year, and any one of those days (besides the cold) would have previously put me in bed for at least a day.  The combination should have put me in hospital for at least four days.  Not to say that I didn't have problems, but thanks in part to techniques and stretches from Mr. Cooley's book, I managed to stay active and motile, and have now almost fully recovered.<br /><br />  To the negative, it could be that Mr. Cooley puts too much stock in his own discoveries, and he is certainly too used to working with people with already-developed athletic capabilities.<br /><br />  First, \\"too much stock in his own discoveries.\\"  The first section of the book describes how Bob Cooley survived a near-death experience, and how he came upon his stretching techniques while recovering for that experience.  I have not yet walked his path long enough to deliver a real judgement, but I suspect that part of the benefits he ascribes to his techniques is actually a normal part of his return trip from death's door.<br /><br />  This is not to say that there is no value in his stretching techniques, but rather that they may not be the \\"univeral fix-everything\\" he represents them to be.<br /><br />  The second negative is that I find his presentation better suited to those who are already developed athletically rather than the majority of us who are somewhat motion impared.  By his own statement, Mr. Cooley discovered his first stretching techniques while attempting a middling-advanced yoga position. His book also includes testimonies from several world-class athletes, which I certainly would not dispute.  However, I had to invent several \\"remedial\\" stretches before even attempting the beginning series of stretches presented in his book (fortunately I have some theraputic streching and hatha yoga in my background), and a few of the illustrations for the beginning stretches seem misleading if not plain wrong.  The intermediate and advanced series appear to be correct, as far as I can currently tell.<br /><br />  Mr. Cooley's basic premise is that first, streching is good and second, stretching against resistance is better.  Theroretically this makes sense, since then all the cells in a muscle would elongate rather than just those involved at the muscle's maximum extension.  Also, \\"resistence stretching\\" is very similar to what most of us do naturally just before or after arising from bed.  However, as noted in the book, the \\"immediate strength\\" of a muscle will decline if only his stretching techniques are used.  Again this makes sense -- from my observation, the existing strength of a muscle becomes \\"spread\\" over the entire range of motion for that muscle, and as the muscle cells and fibers elongate, the \\"new\\" portion of them is weak until strengthened through other forms of exercise.  In fairness, the book points out that the stretches can be turned into strength building exercises by reversing their direction, but the follow-through on this concept is weak.<br /><br />  I don't feel qualified to comment on whether his claimed connection between his exercise cycles and the \\"meridians\\" of traditional Chinese medicine is valid.  I do know that, while many of his positions approximate those of hatha yoga, the muscle groups involved don't necessarily correspond -- for example, the \\"child\\" position in both yoga and western rehabilitation therapy focuses on the lower back and Mr. Cooley uses it to stretch the upper back, shoulders and arms.  Not necessarily wrong, mind you, but a much different emphasis.  Also, the beginning series doesn't quite involve ALL of the muscle groups, at least as I understand them.<br /><br />  In summary:  The book's main feature is \\"resistance stretching\\" (which might also be described as isometrics in motion).  While not the universal panacea it's presented to be, the concept IS quite useful and beneficial. It should be used in addition to other exercise techniques, not as a replacement for them, and Mr. Cooley would do well to include a set of remedial \\"absolute beginner\\" stretches for the less athletic among us.  Meanwhile, I'm glad I got the book, and I intend to keep doing the stretches.	2005-10-14

In five well-balanced chapters, the author opens up the important question about the extent to which the prophet Isaiah-and thus the book that bears his name-was influenced by the strain of Israelite reflection that scholars call 'wisdom'. In setting forth his apology and objectives, Whedbee recognizes the danger of explaining the prophets systematically based upon a narrow selection of texts. For some time, scholars drove a deep wedge between the 'prophet's word' and the 'sage's counsel'.<br /><br />A number of changes in the prevailing scholarly winds have made a study like Whedbee's possible. The sage is now viewed more positively as a guardian of communal integrity than was the case in a previous generation. Also the complex-rather than simple-relationship between traditional wisdom and the prophetic task has become more evident. Whedbee proposes to sort out traditional versus technical wisdom as it appears in Isaiah, presuming that the latter emerges out of the former. Also, he anticipates showing his reader how Isaiah processes and adapts wisdom traditions as he inherits and employs them.<br /><br />Having sketched out a refreshingly loose-fitting-not to say baggy-profile for wisdom and its origins, forms, and intentionalities, Whedbee approaches the formal matter of 'Parables, Proverbs, and Related Gattungen' in an extensive chapter two (pp. 23-79). Methodologically, he cautions against assuming the presence of wisdom influence on Isaiah wherever there is overlap with wisdom terminology. Rather, he seeks distinctive (parabolic) content for the basis of his study. Whedbee is attentive to the 'heterogonous' nature of Isaiah's argumentation, a perspective that allows him to evade the analytical trap of absolutizing genres and then dissecting speeches in order to assign each element to a distinct classification. Isaiah, Whedbee says, is 'free' to use a large number of figures of speech, some of which take a sapiential tack, because the disjunction between prophetic word and creation's witness is a modern rather than an ancient one. For the prophet, the two would have enjoyed an essential unity.<br /><br />In his third chapter ('Woe Oracles and Wisdom', pp. 80-110), Whedbee argues for a close relationship between the Hebrew Bible's 'woe' oracles and the 'ashrey' ('blessed is ...') statements. He approves Gerstenberger's discernment of a strong concern for social justice in both kinds of affirmations, provisionally accepting as well Gerstenberger's theory that the statements derive from popular wisdom settings. After surveying some of the distinctly Isaianic 'woes', Whedbee concludes that both law and wisdom emerge from a common source and thus it is not wise to distinguish too sharply between their respective influence as traditionary sources for Isaiah. Nevertheless, it would be equally unwise to overlook the instructional/sapiential nature of Isaiah's utilization of the tradition.<br /><br />In 'Counsel/Counsellor and Jerusalem Court Wisdom' (ch. four, pp. 111-148), Whedbee argues for a non-secular (in the technical sense) view of professional wisdom circles in biblical Israel and Judah. That is, these circles had their own view of the divine source of counsel and wisdom and their own tradition regarding the inherent limitations of human wisdom. Isaiah's criticism of the sages of his day used their own language ('etsah) and was not uniquely prophetic. Though he criticizes the counsellors of his day, his vision for the future includes wise counsellors, indeed a messianic figure that is cast in part in the figure of just such a counsellor. In contrast to the policies supported by the court counsellors of his day-some of which Isaiah found inimical to Yahwistic faith-the prophet rests in the divine 'counsel' which is not only inscrutable but also trustworthy in its intentions for Israel/Judah.<br /><br />A conclusion (pp. 149-153) neatly restates the outline of an argument that is both cogent and well-presented in the core ofthe book. In the thirty-four years since its publication, Whedbee's work has been criticized but in general has stood its ground admirably. Scholarship regarding the interplay between wisdom, prophecy, and law has been marked by this important work, which now finds itself somewhat in the main stream.e its publication, Whedbee's work has been criticized but in general has stood its ground admirably.

With each new edition that has arrived since the game's conception back in 1989, a new set of rules, more stream lined, more focused on fun rather than rule mongering, has arisen. Shadowrun 4th edition is the biggest rule change yet.<br /><br />Vet's to the game who enjoyed the game for it's rule's, not it's gaming world, have voiced their distaste for the game. I myself was very skeptical of these completely new rules. Let me clarify now, this game has indeed evolved, and these new rules are a step in the right direction. Players of games like Vampire: the Masquarde/the Requiem, Werewolf: the Apocalypse/the Forsaken, and other World of Darkness 1.0 and 2.0 games wil find these rules a bit familiar and comforting.<br /><br />Dice tests are no long single skills with the hopeful adding of a combat or specialty dice pool. Instead, tests are made combining attributes and skills into a combined pool, and all tests aim for the same Target Number \\"Hit\\" of 5. Modifiers just add or take away dice now, and the rule of one has been completly reworked.<br /><br />Thus, all vets to the game line will have to learn a whole new set of rules if htey want to stay alive in the shadows, but that's something they should be used to, adaptation.<br /><br />New Gamers will find these new rule sets much easier to approach than the older sets. While it feels like character creation is more complicated (which is something shadowrun has been known for), gameplay is smoother, the game suffers less from the same old \\"specialty classes getting so much alone time while they do their thing and everyone else gets a big break\\". Instead, with augmented realty (a trend most sci fi groups seem to be taking these days in Cyberpunk games and stories), groups find their Matrix has joined them in the real world.<br /><br />The reason this game loses a star is because there is a standard warning of skepticism. Vets should be warned of the issues with the changed rules. If you loved the rules system and not the game, this isn't an edition you want to pick up.

As someone completely new to aviation, there is so much jargon and unfamiliar equipment and so many acronyms and that the potential for looking stupid seems high. I didn't know what a pitot tube is, and I appreciate the fact that Rod Machado doesn't assume that the reader knows that or even that they know how to pronounce it. He says, \\"that' pee-toe, not pilot\\" which is helpful. If you've hung around airports for the past ten years, you probably already knew how to pronounce it, but I didn't. This excellent attention to detail is this books strength. The author gives not one, but two photographs of pitot tube and explains that they are usually found under the left wing. As another example, I had read elsewhere that you need to test your fuel for water, but a single glance at the two photographs he included turned the concept from some vague ethereal haze in the back of my mind to a simple, \\"Okay. I get it.\\" You can see this here on Amazon by clicking the \\"Look inside this book\\" link under the photograph of the book, then go forward a couple of pages to page A3. Figure 7 at the bottom of the page has the caption: \\"Under the wing is a fuel tank sump drain. Since airplane engines don't seem to run very well on impurities, the sumps should be drained before every flight and after every fueling.\\" Figure 8 next to it shows someone checking for impurities witha clear plastic fuel strainer. Nothing beats seeing it. <br /> <br />What I don't like about this book (and the reason I only gave it four stars) are the dumb jokes. When I read about the silly humor in another review I thought, \\"Lighten up, how bad can it really be?\\" Bad. Worse than you think. In fact, I think it detracts from an otherwise excellent book. What exactly does the author mean in the example above when he says, \\"Since airplane engines don't seem to run very well on impurities...\\"? Apparently, it's a joke (yuk, yuk). Besides from being distracting, it seems like what we get is a joke instead of information: what kind of impurities are we talking about here? Water? Or something else? These jokes are peppered throughout the text and they very quickly become tedious. I wish they were in the margin or in a different font so that I could ignore them. On page A5 the author talks about strobe lights on planes. One sentence starts, \\"This is necessary because...\\" I thought to myself, this must be an important point I'd better remember it. Disappointingly, the sentence ends with \\"...because screaming out the window does not work.\\" If these silly jokes were in a special font I could have more easily skipped over them and they would have been less irritating. <br /> <br />This is a large (as big as a medium size phone book), thorough and very well illustrated book and I'm glad I bought it.	2005-10-14

Several pages later he's listed as the class of 1895.  (1880 is the correct date...)  In discussions of Frank Hinkey, he is mentioned as one of only 5 four-time All Americans.  In the photo section, his picture is accompanied by a description that says he is one of 11 four-time All Americans.  Then, there is discussion of Ivy League football dropping from Division I-A to I-AA.  At first this is mentioned as having happened in 1982.  Later in the book, the 1974 Yale team is noted to have the best defense in Division I-AA.  (But they were still in Division I-A in '74, weren't they?)  <br /> <br />Anyway, these were three glaring errors that I picked up without doing any research or fact-checking.

I was hoping for something more technical along the lines of books published by O'Reilly Publishers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book on how to set up your gopher site and what exactly the .link settings should be, this book won't help you.  There's no information on how to setup a Gopher server, despite the chapter listing.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book with handy tips about using WSGopher, some (outdated?) Gopher links, and some good overview information from a user end, then this book is good.<br /><br />People searching for this book probably already have experience using Gopher.  This book needs to be seriously revised and updated, and possibly a second book aimed more at technical users and Gopher-site developers.	2005-10-14

Sometimes I buzz through the parts about Swiss bank account transfers and customs-house forms. Other times I drink in all those technical details like a foaming schooner of Flemish ale. Depends on your mood, I guess. Regardless, I always savor the action sequences, which are relayed in splendid detail, and Forsyth's unique brand of gallows humor.     This is about how one man sets up and carries out a coup d'etat, dollar by dollar, bullet by bullet. It it not just a shoot-em-up, and those who wish to read such a book should go elsewhere. But for those who savor the details, and camaraderie shared among wild geese in an Ostend bar at the end of a good day's scheming and plotting, this book is one in a million.	2005-10-14

The reason being that when I'm left to my own musings I'm just not a linier thinker. It's not that I go in all different directions. It's that the road to my destination goes serpentine. I'm distracted with thoughts that apply on the fringe and so I'd certainly want to stop and describe where my brain is meandering. That's exactly what Klosterman does here. <br />I do not have author Klosterman's excuse for such mental behavior as I am not a recreational drug user. If this writing technique of ours is actually one that readers appreciate then I should be grateful to my mother for allowing me to skip the inevitable depression that comes of drug and alcohol abuse (and in giving me a timely advantage) by dropping me on my head as a child. I don't actually remember being dropped on my head, but given the unexplained upper forehead scar, my non-drug addled brain, and yet having a Klosterman-esque propensity to mentally wander, I expect she did. <br />Now I must add a, \\"buyer beware!\\" One would normally expect that if an author takes a roundabout course to get where he's going, and if he has a lot to say about his actual topic, then you're going to have a fairly lengthy read. This book is a tiny read. It follows then that Klosterman doesn't end up writing very many pages on topic; that is if his topic is suppose to be dead rock stars.  <br />I bought the book because I wanted to read about dead rock stars and I wanted to be entertained by Klosterman's wit. What we get is a little of both. <br />	2005-10-14

I was captivated by \\"White Teeth\\"'s sometime caricature-ish portrayal of the culturally and ethnically diverse cast of characters:  some of them take themselves too seriously, some of them don't think much of themselves or of their surroundings, but in the author made even the most self-conscious characters be a little self-deprecating in a humorous way.  Details are thrown at the reader either purposefully and effectively, or in a way that adds more color to the writing.  Upon reading the book, I felt that it's alright to take one's self seriously, and it's alright if one doesn't, but that we should both respect and take some humor in our diversity.  In \\"White Teeth\\" I felt that the author used diversity as a very good tool to make captivate the reader's interest, propel the story along, introduce conflict, and introduce humor all at the same time. <br /> <br />In \\"On Beauty\\", there is still that sprinkling of ethnic and cultural details, strong and minute, but they are more often neither necessary nor effective.  It seems that taking all the ethnic, gender, and cultural aspects from this novel will not subtract much from it.  The wit is still there, the cartoonish portrayals of certain archetypes and stereotypes are still there, but they are disconnected from the storyline.  I have not read the original inspiration of this story, so perhaps I am missing something here, but if I hadn't read \\"White Teeth\\" I will still have written the same about \\"On Beauty\\". <br /> <br />If you have read \\"White Teeth\\" and really enjoyed it, then \\"On Beauty\\" is worth the price of admission.  If you have not read \\"White Teeth\\" and know Zadie Smith only from book reviews and interviews, I will only hesitatingly recommend this book.  Perhaps it is Smith's familiarity with the British way of life that makes \\"White Teeth\\" appear to be a moreintegral and effortless piece of writing, but both aspects are lacking in this latest novel.	2005-10-13

Her life is overflowing with one thing after another.  She is a greeting card artist, is working on owning her own Greeting Card store, is dealing with a group of off kilter frinds (very, loyal friends), a brother in a mental hospital and an uncle who maybe should be.  Throw into this that she is part of a dating project in which she has to date 40 men in 60 days.  She has plenty to do. <br /> <br />While on a late night visit to the mental hospital to take her brother aluminum foil (read the book to find out why :)), she first sees a dead body on the way to the hospital lying in the road.  Since she fears that her brother has knowledge of it, or may have something to do with it, she takes no immediate action.  While at the hospital, she is taken somewhat hostage by a man pretending to be a doctor who is actually running from the mob, and has some knowledge of why the guy is dead in the road.   <br /> <br />What follows is a completely amusing and engrossing tale of how this all works out in a really fresh new way of doing so.  I found certain elements just a little far fetched (can't tell you what they are without giving something important away), I still found it a very good read and am currently reading the second in the series. <br /> <br />I found Wollie to be a fun herione with a lot of very real elements about her.  You can't help but like her and look forward to what she might do next.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  I did recognize that the author was an actress and do know who she is.  I don't see why some have made that an issue.  I think her work as an author and as an actress stand alone and speak for themselves.  I recommend her both as an author and an actress.	2005-10-13

The exercises outlined in this book, which I learned in conjunction with physical therapists associated with the New York University medical center, have been immensely helpful in preventing on-going pain and any severe reoccurrence.   <br /> <br />Of course, you should do these exercises only with the consultation of a doctor and/or physical therapist, especially if you have acute back pain caused by a protruding or ruptured disc. Also, of course, you should combine them (eventually) with a program to strengthen and stretch your muscles.  But, as many of you know, with back pain it can be very difficult to do these other exercises until you have found fundamental relief to the underlying causes of the pain, and these exercises, properly applied and for the right cases, can accomplish this. <br /> <br />The limited amount of time they take (litereally a couple of minutes) make these exercises very easy to maintain over time. <br /> <br />Robin McKenzie has been acknowledged around the world for his work with back pain.  His credentials are strong.  If you have found many other books to be generic and not that helpful, this one is different.  If the \\"popularizer\\" title puts you off, or if you are wanting a more in-depth anlaysis-- even if only to reassure yourself of the legitamacy of the medicine behind the exercises-- you can buy and read the formal textbooks he has written. <br /> <br />Good luck!	2005-10-13

I'm learning to speak Italian on my free time and i thought that since i read the Bible anyway, why not learn Italian and read my Bible at the same time?  There's a couple of issues i have though, the Italian used in this Bible is sort of an old Italian language, with words being written slightly different than they are in my Italian language dictionary.  Also, for example, the book of Eclesiastes has either additianal verses in the last chapter or the verse numbering has been changed and made longer. I've noticed this in other places in this Bible as compared to the KJV version.  Also translations change from English to Italian. I also compared the Spanish (Reina-Valera) version of the Bible to this Italian Bible and they are more similar. Over all i'm having fun reading the Bible in Italian.

The COT report is unique to futures however Larry has developed another indicator that provides a similar indicator that is applicable to stocks and futures markets that do not have COT reports available. Exit criteria are discussed on numerous occasions. While entrances are subjective Larry mentions this repeatedly, saying that trading involves 2 steps: 1) setup, which the COT reports can help provide and 2) entry trigger, which he provides some simple techniques he has used over the years.  <br /> <br />While there are references to his advisory and educational services as well as the data/charting company that he uses they are not simply marketing gimmicks.

It is well written and easy to follow, however, given that career development is a hard sell to management, implementation needs to include evaluation of the program as well.  Without showing the benefits of the program to management, career development within an organization will be seen as nothing more than a generous perk.  Many organizations pay for employees undergraduate and/or graduate education - and that often is a generous perk.  But organizations do see that while the employee is still there in the organization, the training and knowledge gained from the education is benefitting the organization.  The same needs to be said about career development.  Knowdell does not provide a lot of how this can help organizations, other than perhaps as a motivation tool for employees.  If you need that info, you'll need to do extra work to look at what research says in that area.  Overall, career development and tuition reimbursements do attract the best candidates to an organization, are developed within the organization, and are retained because they feel valued by the organization.	2005-10-13

Most of what is in this book is already in Black Knight, White Knight. Except for the part about the affair with the married photojournalist.  She left him after 15 years (and somewhere in there her 3rd son committed suicide at age 22)because she met someone else.  However, the guy she's supposedly with at the end of the book, another photographer, she met previous to the married man. So I'm confused.  The printing style, without full justification, didn't help either.<br /><br />But she did give some brief information about being embezzled by her doctor and lawyer, and losing all her money.  Even though she didn't recover a penny of it from them, she was back on the street like she didn't miss a beat. It helps to have rich friends.<br /><br />One good thing about this book was the photos.  You get to see Gloria Vanderbilt not even looking like Gloria Vanderbilt (not so harshly made up and softer-looking). But the writing does seem dashed off and glosses over too much for me to give it but 3 stars.	2005-10-13
US	52423461	R2E6IQYQNE5MQW	0141019646	643055675	In Command Of History: Churchill Fighting And Writing Second World War	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	The Politician as Historian or Vice Versa?	I found this volume to be extremely interesting, even fascinating at times.  It focuses upon the writing of Winston Churchill's epic \\"The Second World War,\\" whose six volumes were a major publishing event around the world, and eventually earned Churchill a Nobel Prize for literature. It is really several different books in one. <br /> <br />    First, much like Ashley's \\"Churchill as Historian,\\" the author discusses the actual mechanics of writing so massive a project when Churchill had plenty of other things to keep him busy.  The \\"syndicate\\" of experts who assisted him, including even the Parliamentary Cabinet Office, is analyzed in great detail. According to the author, the \\"three D's\\" were the core of Churchill's method.  That is, first he had set in type the key documents which he had collected during his wartime service as Prime Minister. Then he tied the documents together with dictated reminiscenses.  Finally, the third \\"D\\" consisted of a very large number of drafts whereby the documents were edited down and the connecting narrative supplemented with WC's own recollections or papers drafted by syndicate members. Ironically, it is Churchill's heavy reliance upon documents that at once has yielded much praise from other historical researchers (since otherwise they would not have been made public for as much as 50 years after the war's conclusion),but also generated negative reactions from lay readers, especially in the U.S. <br /> <br />     Next, the really interesting issues are tackled.  For example, how candid and accurate was WC regarding his actions during the war?  The author extremely well documents how WC would edit documents, or even modify them, in order to (not surprisingly) put himself in the best historical light.  Also, he was duty bound not to reveal the existence of \\"Ultra,\\" which was the designation for breaking the German code during the war. Given the fact that in the postwar period, others were also writing books (e.g., Ike with his \\"Crusade in Europe\\" and Sherwood's \\"Roosevelt and Hopkins\\"), WC would frequently modify his drafts in order to obviate any possible taint regarding his decisions and actions while PM in a stab at vindication.  One good example was the dispute that arose over whether WC had favored or retarded the \\"Overlord\\" invasion of France in 1944. Churchill also faced the practical constraints of the Cold War being on-going and also acting as head of the Conservative Party and ultimately PM for a second time.  These factors too influenced how he structured the text. <br /> <br />     Of course a most intriguing question is did WC really write the work given the extensive assistance he received?  The author suggests a useful analogy: WC was like a master chef at a large restaurant who designs and directs the menu, while others do much of the actual food preparation.  He also likens it to a group project in science, where a number of folks collaborate on a paper which is attributed to the lead author. Clearly, it is Churchill's book even though he did not write all of it himself--but he reviewed every sentence and corrected or struck out that with which he disagreed.  <br /> <br />    Finally, in a most interesting discussion, the author recounts the arguments that arose during the 1955-1965 period as other historians, military figures, and the leaders of other countries (such as De Gaulle) took aim on Churchill's analysis.  Not quite as challenging as fighting Hitler, but still quite a nice war of its own.  The author, Professor of International History at Cambridge, has done just a superior job.  Be warned, it is a long book (over 600 pages) and the Penguin edition is set in very small type.  But the rewards of the book more than compensate for these problems, especially for those of us interested in Churchill. The stream of Churchill volumes continues unabated and has even increased recently--but this book should be singled out for the unique perspective it affords us on \\"the great man.\\"	2005-10-13

As a bonus, King recommends my standby reference on writing, \\"Elements of Style,\\" by William Strunk Jr. & E.B. White.<br /><br />Leave it to King, The Master, to write this semi-autobiographical expose on authorship craft in a more intriguingly unique organizational setup than anyone else could conjure or dare. Leave it to Him to force (or else) a (sort of) \\"how to\\" book into mesmerizing entertainment; to step into the job with a horrific grab about a kid suffering ear drum puncture; and to coerce an anomaly of styles and content to coalesce into a gestalt of genius which WORKS, period.<br /><br />How can a book on writing be riveting?? Read it and see.<br /><br />King includes only those riveting parts of his personal history which have contributed to his writing career. He includes only the necessary elements to \\"teach\\" how to spark and stir creative fires. He includes only the necessary keys to his success (amazingly, he does know what those keys are).<br /><br />I was impressed with King's exposure of his method of writing from a SITUATION rather than from a precise PLOT outline; I still find myself chewing on that daring technique (though I do still appreciate a strongly plotted story).<br /><br />I was interested in his examples of bad and good prose, and agree with his praise of other works, though I reserve judgment on a few of his criticisms, and have developed techniques to take breaks whenever I need them without permanently losing a creative flow, which I can renew at almost any point if I can set up the right conditions.  (When I break through with as many Number One Best Sellers as Mr. King has, maybe my opinion on writing will be as viable as his.)<br /><br />King has many times earned the right to have an opinion on writing and to offer it for sale. Yet, he has approached this project with genuine humility, which is, to me, endearing (sorry about the sentimental slip, Oh Master of Horror).<br /><br />What do I admire most about this author, which is evident in this book? I absolutely enjoy his regenerating honesty, his uncanny originality, and his demand of himself to toss reader boredom into a black hole and perform, within his printed words, 24/7 without fail. Also love the way he sincerely and humbly exposes his respect for his wife.<br />Given what this man has endured and accomplished in his life, he's earned the best type of REST available to a human being, and I don't mean the big \\"D.\\" He deserves to be quite proud of himself. He deserves to have his thumbs permanently posed in the sides of a vest, to sit back and smile at his trail of effort and result.<br /><br />What a gift that he would attempt in earnest to share his secrets of writing success. And his uncanny self-awareness allowed him to share clearly what those secrets are, in this valuable gift for the youngest as well as the most seasoned of writers. This I say as a 2 decades professional writer and previous English and creative writing teacher who has published various articles and finished and polished 8 fiction manuscripts and has another 8 + book-length works in progress.  I'm not EVEN near King's level in the marketplace (yet), but I am a highly productive creative spirit who knows how to maintain, ride, and design the flow.<br /><br />There's always more than one way to approach any creative endeavor, and my approach to writing is similar to King's in some ways, somewhat different in other ways (I can only compare, of course, to the content offered in this book).  This insight to King's techniques exposes what works for him and what could work for other, though of course not all creative spirits.  Young writers should allow themselves leeway in deciding how to tap and work with their talents.  Creativity should be allowed to flourish, even when establishing a personal method on how to use that force, and sometimes it's necessary to forge a unique path diverging from even the greatest masters.  When I was teaching creative writing in the public school systems, I asked my students to at least try some of the established methods of writing prior to setting any of them aside to break away from them.<br /><br />Another great book which exposes a writer's path and techniques (through a novel rather than through a unique how to book) is THE NOVEL by James A. Michener.  See my review.<br /><br />What I believe On Writing has exposed better than many writing \\"how to\\" books is tapping into the Right Brain.  As I've observed the styles of many authors of novels, they each seem to be almost \\"designed\\" by DNA to work in different precise balances of Right/Left Brain.  The Left Brain wants steps, plots, outlines, plans and structure to be elaborately perfect prior to that leap into the ozone.  The pure Right Brain wants only the chaos of riding a storm of the absolute unknown, describing it as it explodes into the presence of present time, constantly changing, churning.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, telling a fledgling writer how to do it is, for me, a frightening extension of my uniqueness, because I would not ever want to hamper the growth of a maverick creative source needing by its design to walk a path not taught by any master before him.  Possibly every \\"how to\\" book should carry a warning.<br /><br />This one enters the effort in fairness, with humility and honesty, and does not say or imply, \\"This is THE only way to write.\\"<br /><br />Thank you, Stephen, for sharing your personal and professional views on writing, which expose your adept use of both sides of the brain, highlighting your ability to slip into the quirks of the Right side in intriguingly clear ways.

I also used \\"Hawaii Revealed\\" on a visit to the big island with similar results. In many other places you are taking a chance on the reliability and accuracy of reviews of activities, reviews, directions, etc. but I find this book is right on. Since it's written from experience, I've found you can rely on the descriptions without question. The vendors for activities were exactly as described. The ways to beaches were exactly as described. The restaurants were exactly as described. While it's not all-inclusive (it's pretty hard to stay at every possible condo), the authors provide enough choices that they have personally explored that you will have plenty of choices too.<br /><br />A reminder to the reviewer who calls us tourists \\"maggots\\" - we are providing your economy and supporting the peoples of the state in so many ways. The book makes many, many references to the need to respect private property, and for respecting the ecosystem as well. It's up to the visitor to do this, really - I've always felt a strong sense of \\"visiting\\" in Hawaii, the spirit of the Hawaiian place and peoples is very strong to me and I feel like I am privileged to share some time with the sights and features. I urge other visitors to similarly respect the traditions and ecosystem when you visit. Hopefully during your visit you won't run into many kama`ainas so possessive of their \\"private\\" paradise - we found everyone to be friendly and welcoming, born there or not.	2005-10-13

Mr K is positively bubbling with enthusiasim.  Had it not been taken by Joe Namath a suitable title might have been \\"The Future's So Bright I Just Gotta Wear Shades\\".  But therein lies the problem.  Mr K comes across more like a passionate evangelical than a reasoned scientist.  Whenever someone is absolutley convinced about the rightness of his assumptions I become skeptical. <br /> <br />     If you're reading this you know the premise of the book.  Mr. K maintains that the pace of technological change (and by technology he means the really cool technologies, like infotech, biotech, and nanotech) is not simply increasing, but increasing exponentially, so fast that we will soon reach a point where man and machine have become one, and are brains are a million (or maybe a billion) times more powerful.  When this happens everything we know will have changed forever. <br /> <br />     Moreover, this is not someting that will happen at some vague time in the far future.  It's just around the corner.  Mr. K even gives us a date: 2045. <br /> <br />     While reading the book I kept thinking, What if Mr. K had written this in the mid 1950's?  Certainly he'd have backup for his basic premise--the changes that occured in the first half of the 20th century were indeed tremendous.  Take aviation, a hot technology in those days.  Mr. K would no doubt have observed that we went from Kitty Hawk to the Boeing 707 in just 50 years.  Projecting ahead, Mr. K would have concluded that the second half of the century would see an even greater rate of advancement, so that by now we'd all have our own personal flying devices, zipping off to Europe in just minutes. <br /> <br />    But that hasn't happened.  Certainly there has been signigicant progress in aviation in the last 50 years, but not like the 50 years before that.  In some says it's worse.  I suspect that since 9/11 the time it takes to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco (from the time you get to one airport to the time you leave the other) may be longer now than it was in the 1950's. <br /> <br />    Why has this happened?  A lot of this has to do with social conditions, not technological ones.  Supersonic trasport never got off the ground (so to speak) in part because people didn't want the sonic booms near populated areas.  These same social factors may well put the brakes on a lot of what Mr. K predicts. <br /> <br />     It's not that Mr. K's book isn't based on hard science.  It's positively larded with science, so much so that my eyes tended to glaze over many times.  It's just that he doesn't seem very critical.  While he does acknowledge the existence of contrary opinion, he quickly (albeit politely) dismisses any cautionary thoughts.  Those who disagree with his beliefs are clearly stuck-in-the-mud, nay-saying Luddites. <br /> <br />    Mr K is obviously a brilliant, well-informed scientist.  I don't have enough knowledge to judge the accuracy of his facts, except in a few situations.  When that does occur, though, I become unimpressed.  For example, he spends a few pages talking about the increases that have occured in life expectancy, and uses this to project further increases to 150 years and then to 500 years.  But he fails to distinguish between life exoectancy and life span.  The former has indeed increased, but the latter has not.  I am certain Mr. K knows the difference.  His failure to make the distinction is misleading and disingenuous.  It makes me wonder about the veracity of the rest of the book. <br /> <br />     As to the book itself, it's far too long.  He repeats his points so much it seems as though he thinks that by mere repetition the reader will become more convinced that he's right.  And some parts of the book are simply annoying, like the smug pseudo-conversations among past, present, and future personages that appear throughout the work. <br /> <br />To his credit, though, his optimisim about the future is refreshing, and certainly an antidote to the dystopian views typical in literature and Hollywood (Brave New World, 1984, Blade Runner, Mad Max, The Terminator, Waterworld, etc.). <br /> <br />     The bottom line here is that Mr. K. doesn't seem to remember that virtually all predictions about the future are wrong, since the predictions are simply extrapolations of current trends.  The future is never what we think it will be, and Mr. K is no exception. <br /> <br />     Then again, he could be right.  If so, I just hope I can live long enough to enjoy the sigularity, so I can have my body filled with nanobots and my brain uploaded to (as he would say) a suitable substrate.  Maybe being a cyborg won't be so bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />     <br />	2005-10-13

I cannot imagine what it must be to have lost both your husband (and all he was to you during your 45 years with him) and your daughter.  I hope that the strength you have shown in writing this book will continue to sustain you and make your life meaningful.  I read your book through quickly, as your thoughts and reactions were so much like mine, and seemed a validation that what I was feeling was okay and natural.  I lost my 44 year-old son in August, after taking care of him for three months (he was diagnosed with an inoperable, stage 4 brain tumor in April, and we tried everything to save him.)  I understand the vortex of memories, appearing from nowhere, bringing you to your knees.  I discovered that the reason I couldn't sleep was that I was still half-awake listening for my son to get up during the night, as he did so often.  Closing my bedroom door has helped.  We spent so much time in the car driving to labs, the ER, doctor appointments - always with the radio playing the music he loved -and now the only thing I can stand is songs sung in Spanish - because lyrics that you can't understand can't hurt you.  So, yes, the book and the way it was written was, for me, an opportuunity to talk intimately with someone who knew how I was feeling.  It grates on me to read reviews of the quality of the writing.  This writing was from the heart, and it spoke to mine.	2005-10-13

The first ones, Templars and Hospitallers, were founded in the XII Century, after the First Crusade, in order to protect pilgrims in the Holy Land and to provide humanitarian and medical services. Soon, these monks became more warriors than anything else, true machines of war which came to be the first organized and properly trained and disciplined professional elite troops in the West since the Roman Empire. The West and Islam lived then (and still do) in a permanent state of threat and holy war. Although these warriors made vows of poverty, obedience and chastity, they soon accumulated enormous riches, fighted one another and their discipline, especially in sexual matters, relaxed.<br /><br />The first part of the books tells the two centuries of Christian occupation in the Holy Land, which the Islam had taken by force centuries before, and where, despite some resounding successes, the Christians ended up being totally defeated and expelled, to this day. The second part tells the story of the Crusade in the Baltic, performed by the Teutonic Knights against the pagan Slav Prussians, terrifying cannibals adoring spirits in trees, as well as snakes in the woods. These Teutonics founded what was probably the first \\"modern\\" state: Prussia (the German one). This story is practically unknown, in spite of being totally fascinating. The third part is the Reconquest of Spain, where the orders were crucial in defeating the Moors. Then come the stories of the Hospitallers in Rhodes and Malta -also wonderful- and then what became of the existing orders today.<br /><br />One striking common theme during the thousand years covered is the permanent and bloody conflict between the West and Islam. In spite of the torrent of names, places and dates, this book is an incredible collection of adventures and improbable deeds, especially the sieges of Acre, Rhodes and Malta, as well as the Spanish Reconquista and the Prussian episode. The tone of the book is apologetic, the author himself being a Knight of Malta, but it also vividly portraits the terrible atrocities committed by both sides. It fills a huge vacuum in the historical and political education of almost any reader, besides being an impressive saga of courage, dedication, violence, survival, glory, triumph, defeat and corruption at the same time. It really motivates you to read more about this subject.on of adventures and improbable deeds, especially the sieges of Acre, Rhodes and Malta, as well as the Spanish Reconquista and the Prussian episode.

In Volume 4, Masumi is off to study at England's Royal Ballet Academy.  There she must confront her rival, the fiery Sidney Ecklund, as well as overcome her own artistic shortcomings.  Along the way she also meets and receives encouragement from legendary ballerina Margot Fonteyn. <br /> <br />\\"Swan\\" is interesting is that it deals with the reality of ballet - auditions, nerves, endless practices, and injuries.  As a dancer myself, I can identify to some extent with Masumi's love for ballet and her desire to excel.  We also get to meet leading lights from the ballet world of the 1970's (when this manga was written and takes place) - Maya Plisetskaya, Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev, and the Bolshoi Ballet. <br /> <br />What bothers me about \\"Swan\\" is its heavy-handed, soap-opera-esque, OMG EMOTION that saturates every page.  I know that this can be a regular occurrence in manga, but there are times when I wanted to smack Masumi upside the head and tell her to get a grip - the girl cries, as one character notes, \\"at the drop of a hat.\\"  But the most glaring problem with \\"Swan\\" is the lack of fact-checking.  The real-life dancers and ballets are misspelled or misidentified - \\"Margaret\\" Fonteyn, Maya \\"Prisetskaya\\", \\"The Hunchback Pony\\" (better known as \\"The Little Humpbacked Horse\\"), and who the heck is \\"WALDORF\\" Nureyev?!?  This may be a result of poor translation, but someone should have caught these blatant errors. <br /> <br />\\"Swan\\" is probably best for pre-teen and young teen girls perhaps dreaming of their own turn in the spotlight.  Older readers - especially those with some knowledge of ballet - might find it a bit too overdone.	2005-10-13

This asset-building approach to youth development and community development is solidly based on extensive research and meta-research.  Thousands of youth have been surveyed to yield the great information.  Written for parents, community volunteers and professionals who work with children & youth, it describes 40 qualities (or assets) which help youth thrive.  The more of the 40 assets a youth has the better he/she does.  A university student body president I knew felt he had 39 of the 40 assets; since I knew him to be a fabulous kid, it validated the asset-building framework for me.  I urge every parent to get and read this, apply what you learn to your kids, and then go out and make your community more youth friendly.  I have 3 copies; two of which are \\"loaners\\".	2005-10-13

Why do I then only give it three stars? The author explains everything very well. HOWEVER, for someone that's never used the router before, words often leave you fumbling. A picture is worth 1000 words and it couldn't be more true in this case. There are pictures. Just no enough of them and they're in a weird black and white and funny kind of red deal. Not very clear at all. So you often have two pages of words where one clear picture would have replaced all of it and done a better job. <br /> <br />The second problem I had was the fact that this book essentially ignores the plunge router. This is fine. He pretty much shows how you can do everything with the vertical and horizontal router table and the many, many jigs, fences and accessories. However, I bought a mid power (2 1/4 HP) porter cable plunge router and almost feel that I should return it for the 3 HP one which would have cost me the same amount of money because his bias seems to indicate the plunge router is not necessary. <br /> <br />Finally, the part where he mentions how to add a switch to your router table is confusing. Thank goodness I know how electrical work, so I could figure things out. However, SJT appliance cable is not something you can pick up at your local home depot.

I used the 3 glowing reviews on this product to make my decision in purchasing it. Before I gripe, I'll try to find some nice things to say. I was very impressed with the production quality of the book and the detailed information in the biography section. The transcriptions were note-for-note pretty good. The tab's a little off from video recordings of Django playing these same tunes, but the notes are right.<br /><br />That's about where it ends, though. The recording, while technically a decent recording, offers no insight to Django's phrasing or timing of the notes. There are entire passages where it felt like Rod was just playing the notes and nothing more. Other times, notes were missed, played sloppily or not picked up by the mic, leading to a sloppy, unrehearsed sound. There's an entire passage in the Minor Swing recording where Rod plays the most boring note-for-note reiteration of his transcription despite Django's clear swing rhythm and sliding techniques on the same passage in the recording it was transcribed from.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great book to get as a bio, and a pretty good one for the transcriptions. However, don't try to learn from the CD, because Django would probably be rolling over in his grave. Learn from the master himself, and those that came after him (Fapy Lafertin, The Rosenberg Trio, etc.). They are the real deal, and they will play it right. Copy them, not Rod.	2005-10-13

US	21924524	R3TYCFHJI5SYW6	0879308656	658294281	All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music (All Music Guides)	Books	4	80	81	N	Y	A unique new guide ... but oh-so tiny print	This giant, 5 lb, small-print guide is not exactly a book you nestle down with in your reading chair.  Let the buyer beware: if you are a person who cannot or does not like to read really, really FINE PRINT, then this guide is probably not for you.  It has by far the tiniest print I have seen in a book - even smaller than the \\"Third Ear Guide to Classical Music\\" if you are familiar with that one.<br /><br />In my first look at this monster-of-a-guide, I could not get beyond this tiny print and the overly-plain visual layout.  But, with another long look, the value of this unique guide started to stand out clearly. There is a reason for such tiny print - to cram in an unbelievably vast amount of information in one volume.  The All Music Guide is enormously ambitious in what is contains:<br />o  BIOGRAPHIES of over 500 composers AND 800 performers (unprecidented in one volume)<br />o  Fairly detailed PROGRAM NOTES for an impressively large number of works (not just the major ones)<br />o  Listings of 2-6 RECOMMENDED RECORDINGS for each work (but no comparison or explanations of the choices like Penguin)<br />o  ESSAYS on the major musical periods and forms (difficult to read these longer sections with the tiny font size!)<br /><br />The amount and level of detail of the program notes is impressive - giving musical history, perspective and minor analysis for not only a given category of work (say, Mozart's 27 piano concertos) but also most or all of the individual works!  These essays are not unlike those found in a CD liner notes.  So, with this guide, you can look up the background and musical insights of Mozart's concerto #20 as well as see what recordings/astists are recommended for that one concerto. The only other guide that does this is Penguin Guide.  So, now can you appreciate why this book has such tiny print and weighs a ton?  But, as enormous as this guide is, don't expect EVERY composition to be listed.  For instance, under \\"Beethoven\\" there is ample discussion about the string quartets, there is little text or recordings for the ten violin sonatas and early string trios.<br /><br />Another valuable aspect for many will be the biographies of the great past and present PERFORMERS.  This volume contains fairly detailed highlights of each artist career (2-4 paragraphs) AND a listing of their finest recordings for performers like Argerich, Grumiaux, Perlman, Perahia, Rubinstein, Horowitz, Galloway, Holzinger, Bain and so on.  (But some of your personal favorites may not be there - like Rachel Podger and Pamela Frank for me).  However, I found the performer biographies a bit dry with not enough juicy details about their lives, styles and sometimes quirky sides to make it really compelling and interesting.  (tip: one of the best books for fascinating personal stories on the great pianists is David Dubal's book, \\"The Art of the Piano\\").<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that the AMG is NOT a CD/DVD guide as it only LISTS a few recommended recordings and does not compare/contrast/explain them (like Penguin, Third Ear, or Gramophone Guides).  But, then again the title says \\"Guide to Classical Music\\" and not \\"Guide to CD's DVD's\\" like the others.  So, its a different animal.  But, I thought the AMG's focused recommendations were up-to-date and reliable overall, giving a good range of historic, modern, and budget choices.  All-in-all, a valuable addition if you already have Penguin, Gramophone and Third Ear Guides to Classical Music.	2005-10-13

Having read all 6 books in the series I can say that J.K. Rowling is nowhere near the quality writer that J.R.R. Tolkein and C.S. Lewis were. Second, I would never recommend these books to young readers because of the violence that gets increasingly worse in each succeeding book.  The books  characters, i.e. witches, wizzards, etc. use \\"good\\" magic and \\"bad\\" magic. There is no such thing as \\"good\\" magic. These books stir up an unhealthy interest in the occult and the blackness that accompanies it. Harry Potter and his friends also take great delight in the misfortunes of others and many times contrive to cause these misfortunes to occur to those they dislike.  I would not recommend it for children.  The books are mildly interesting, causing the reader to want to know what happens next, but the story drags on in many places which tends to cause boredom with the story.	2005-10-13

This is the best book I have ever read on Foucault, no contest--though one must be clear that Halperin is EXPLICITLY NOT attempting any general and comprehensive explanation of Foucault's life work and thought, which Halperin makes quite clear, though there seems to be some confusion below regarding this point.  In fact, the tone of some of the reviews only serve as a demonstration of some of Halperin's points.   <br /> <br />My main criticism is that I would go even a little further than Halperin with respect to Foucault's actual purpose or mission in _The History of Sexuality_.  I would say that, with volumes two and three, Foucault has shifted his purpose from a general \\"history\\" (hence the title) of the rise of \\"sexuality\\" to a deconstructive and very narrow focus on certain discourses in antiquity that ostensibly SEEM to mirror our own while actually being quite alien to it.  It just so happens that these ancient discourses are about men.  From this perspective, all the complaining of a small but very loud minority of feminists merely reflects a failure to understand what Foucault was doing.  He wasn't trying to give us a general history; rather, he became fascinated by how the ancient world's most familiar discourses (which are about men) could, in fact, be extremely different, by the demonstration and analysis of that difference.  As for general history, Foucault repeatedly refers the reader to Dover's _Greek Homosexuality_, which was published between volumes one and two, and which he just as repeatedly tells us he accepts in basic outline.  Feeling there was no longer an urgent need for a \\"history,\\" he gave us his actual second and third volumes.  Should he have given us a hint he was changing course?  He did!--in the introduction of the second volume.  Readers need to learn to be a bit more active--though, clearly, as original, good, and rigorous as the thinking and analysis may be, it does make for a rather uniquely structured set of books.	2005-10-13
US	50300020	R38JVUTO9F2M0F	1594200319	816807979	Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise	Books	3	31	37	N	Y	Very entertaining, but I have some reservations	Reichl's book, like her famous double review of Le Cirque, raises the probing question of whether the \\"best\\" restaurants truly have earned their titles by treating all of their customers as four stars restaurant should, or whether, instead, the four star treatment is reserved for \\"special\\" patrons.  With that question she delves into issues related to food, class, and economics from her unique and powerful perspective as the NY Times restaurant reviewer.  The reader cheers her reviews of Le Cirque, Tavern on the Green and The Box Tree, in which she took powerful restaurants to task for their failure to treat ALL patrons (rather than just the most well-known or privileged) with the respect and graciousness for which they have paid.  My husband and I now have the luxury of being able to eat at such restaurants from time-to-time (though certainly not regularly), and we usually happily get what we paid for.  But we *have* had occasional negative experiences like Reichl describes, and have seen others have them as well.  As Reichl recognizes, many people \\"save up\\" to eat at these establishments, or visit them for very \\"special occasions,\\" only to be treated poorly.  Restaurants who do not give the \\"four star treatment\\" to *every* guest (rather than the select few) are NOT, by definition, \\"four star\\" and do not deserve to be treated as though they are.     Taking this point one step further, Reichl also uses her reviews to make New Yorkers understand that truly good cuisine need not be expensive, and need not be French.  Her positive reviews of ethnic cuisine are educational and delightful.  In short, Reichl might be seen as the democratizer of the NY Times restaurant reviews.    However, at various points in the narrative Reichl seems to suffer from snobbery of her own (which she largely fails to recognize).  Her behavior at dinner with the man who paid for a meal with her at a charity auction-- showing up his food knowledge, expressing extreme frustration that he wantedto eat at a nice restaurant-- and her nasty comments about the young couple next to her at another restaurant, for example, exhibited a sense of superiority that seems to run beneath the surface of her narrative.  She acknowledges her poor behavior on these occasions through the words of her friends or her husband, but it would have been nice to see a bit more recognition of her limitations in her own words or discussion about her growth from these experiences.      In addition, the deep \\"transformations\\" that Reichl claims overtook her when she was in disguise seem contrived.  While I understand the need for the disguises, I (again) do not understand her need to \\"become\\" these characters and while \\"in character\\" treat others poorly, such as by leaving a cab driver no tip or making rude comments about others.          While I found the book enjoyable, Reichl generally likeable, and the restaurant reviews fascinating, Reichl offended me by including her negative views on, and review of, Windows on the World.  Writing in 2005, Reichl unquestionably knows that Windows on the World perished in the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, together with approximately 80 members of its dedicated staff who were on duty that morning, including its executive pastry chef and countless workers who undoubtedly took pride in their work at what was a pillar of New York.  They are the images we see in news coverage waving towels out the windows of the top floor, begging for rescue.  We have seen some of their family members speak on television about the delight some of them took from working at such a renowned establishment.  Her inclusion of Windows seemed totally unnecessary except to tell her story about dinner with the \\"obnoxious\\" charity guest she could not stand.  Did she really need to kick these people, or the memories of these people, while they were down?  How hard would it have been to edit out?         The book is very entertaining, and I applaud Reichl for democratizing the Times' restaurant reviews.  I just wish she had been a little more thoughtful about what details she chose to include, and how she chose to frame them.	2005-10-13

I've been looking for good reference books to help me really learn the correct way to stitch.  This book is at the top of my list!  I love the layout -- starting with the basics and working up to the most complicated techniques.  The excellent illustrations and explainations on the right and wrong way to stitch really helped me to see what I was doing wrong and how to stitch the right way.  And I know for a fact that the explainations on how to fix stitching and/or cutting errors are easy to understand and follow.  Whenever I come to a stitch I haven't done before, this is the first book I pull out! <br /> <br />Now, lets talk about the projects and pictures.  There's a color photo for each project in the middle of the book and a black & white photo with each project.  The charts range from beginner to advanced level, and trust me, you'll want to stitch each one.  The fibers and fabrics called for are pretty easy to acquire either from your local store or the internet; and if you need to substitute something, you can do so with ease. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book highly enough!!  And if you have any questions about the designs or techniques, you can reach the author via e-mail and she's friendly and very happy to help.  Whether you're a beginner or have been stitching for years, you can't go wrong by adding this book to your library!	2005-10-13

Yockey's big opus \\"Imperium,\\" emulating Spengler and other such writers, was a know-all interpretation of all of history past, present, and especially future.  All very deep.  Yockey's other contribution was his admiring interpretation of Soviet Communism, but only after Yockey judged it to have sufficiently turned against the Jews.  This analysis, again, very sophisticated, very deep. <br /> <br />Yockey also had a knack of quarreling with just about everyone he knew, especially with those who shared his views.  When a fellow Nazi thought that he might not have purely Aryan background, Yockey shot back:  \\"My height is that of Adolf Hitler, my complexion is white ... you will give me satisfaction [at a duel] ... I shall flog you before witnesses. \\"   <br /> <br />Who would care about a nasty crackpot like that ?  Who would spend time researching all the nooks and crannies of that kind of life  ?  Well, Coogan did, and he deserves our thanks, at least moderately so. <br /> <br />Yockey's life could indeed have been a very significant subject if it had been used as an example in a wider study of the Nazi fringe in America.  Coogan gives us precious little of that kind of material. He does tell us something, for example, about the Nazi propagandist Willis Carto.  But Carto's interesting recent  history -- quarrels with other neo-Nazis, etc. -- are not covered.  Coogan is too focused on Yockey to ever tell us much about related persons and grouplets.  A broader focus would have made this book much more valuable. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I am glad that Coogan did all this digging.  At least now we have the goods on one American Nazi, if not the whole phenomenon.	2005-10-13

One may argue that there are more \\"important\\" cars (or not); perhaps the story of Daimler and Maybach's pioneering efforts, or Henry Ford's, are more \\"important\\" in a larger historical context than the activities of a relatively small maker of specialist sports and racing cars, but that's not what I claim here. I claim that this is the best WRITTEN, most thorough autombile history ever. Porsche, as an automobile and an enterprise, is a very special phenomenon, and Ludvigsen's book presents both company and car to an audience that may otherwise never appreciate it. If you don't like Porsches, then that doesn't matter. If you do, you need this book. If you're not sure, then this book may be the beginning of a lifelong passion for all things Porsche.  <br /> <br />That's how it was with me. I bought myself the much slimmer (but still hefty, at 860 pages) first edition of this book as a Christmas present in 1977. It was instrumental in changing my career path; it affected my choices in university engineering courses, and of a master's thesis. Eventually, six years later, I found myself working as an engineer at Porsche. Incidental to my regular engineering duties, I was often called upon to help some of the leading engineers in the company -- men whose stories I had once read about in Ludvigsen -- write English-language presentations and technical papers. This led to my career expanding to include automotive journalism, engineering writing and technical translation, but the passion for Porsche remains. I have three vintage 356s in the garage, and it was Ludvigsen's book that made me appreciate the virtues of these rolling historical documents. <br /> <br />Karl Ludvigsen is one of the few truly outstanding automotive writers of our time. I can think of only a handful of others who can compare in depth of knowledge and facility with the language (or several languages, in Ludvigsen's case) -- Paul Frere (also eminently multilingual, and a multilingual engineer) and LJK Setright come to mind. Being a bilingual engineer myself, I appreciate even more than most the job that Ludvigsen did in researching this book; his translations into English of many concepts and expressions from company-internal documents are faultless, and definitive. The subjects covered in Ludvigsen's other books include Mercedes, Ferrari, Jaguar, V12 engines, early history of Volkswagen, Indianapolis racers, and Can-Am -- all of which were done in the same outstanding manner. I mention this only because there is one overwhelmingly negative review for this book, posted by somebody who is very poorly informed indeed. That reviewer says \\"Mr. Ludvigsen glosses over the problems with the 356 and early 911 road cars...\\" Not true. When I went to work for Porsche, I found that I already had an excellent working knowledge of foibles and problems encountered with earlier Porsche cars, thanks to Ludvigsen's book. The reviewer also says \\"Mr. Ludvigsen glosses...the internal power struggles within the company and board, and so on.\\" Again not true. The Porsche-Piech, and other, battles are well documented. And the reviewer says \\"If I'd realized Mr. Ludvigsen had a past history of writing for Automotive Quarterly, I would never have wasted this much money buying this set. Just like Automotive Quarterly (which never had a bad thing to say about any automobile).\\" As for \\"never had a bad thing to say about any automobile,\\" I am an author who has also written for Automobile Quarterly, and I have to wonder if perhaps there is another publication of that name, because that's not the AQ that I know. I know this firsthand because among other things, I wrote what I think is a brutally honest history of the Chevrolet Cosworth Vega (AQ, 1989, Vol. 27 No. 3). Incidentally, the first, 1977 edition of \\"Excellence was Expected\\" was published by AQ.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, Ludvigsen's \\"Porsche: Excellence was Expected\\" belongs in the automotive library of anyone who seeks the definitive history of the Porsche marque, the company, and a chronicle of more than a half century of sports car racing history as seen from the perspective of its most successful practitioners.	2005-10-13

Fianc&eacute;e Holly Canton, daughter of the local sheriff of Palmetto County, has asked him to retire from the force. As much as she loves him, she's determined not to lose a second husband in the line of duty. Two years later, after several unsuccessful attempts to take down brutal drug lord, Carlos Santiago, Johnny capitulates and plans to devote the rest of his life to Holly and her thirteen-year-old son, Colin.<br /><br />Life doesn't cooperate, however, when Santiago stages a massacre on Sand Key, targeting Johnny. Holly and Colin are slaughtered in the crossfire. Johnny and his loyal police dog, Rex, are gravely wounded.<br /><br />Enter Enola, the strong, steadfast Seminole nurse who rescues Johnny and Rex from certain death and secrets them off to a tribal village to recuperate. A natural beauty and empathetic spirit, Enola contributes to Johnny's recovery with more than her knowledge of medicine. Armed with cunning tribal methods and the help of the village elder, Johnny struggles to beat the death sentence imposed by Santiago.<br /><br />Meanwhile, something's rotten in the sheriff's office. No one knew about Johnny's trip to Sand Key except the sheriff and his coworkers. Johnny suspects each in turn, until his investigative powers flush out the culprit responsible for leaking the information to Santiago and his band of killers. As he heals emotionally and physically, Johnny plots to take down Santiago's empire. The climax is replete with tension and nail biting action - the perfect and righteous revenge.<br /><br />There is much more to this riveting novel than a clever plot and magnetic characters. The prose is smooth and engaging, the dialogue is natural, and the sense of place is immediate. The Florida waterways come alive with gators, mosquitoes, buttonwood trees, exotic birds, and thousands of slow moving streams that snake beneath the mossy overhangs. It is with a sense of acute nostalgia combined with satisfaction that the reader turns the last page. Burdick possesses a rare talent - and is my new favorite writer.

After seeing her on television, I thought it would be a great book to have and be full of helpful information. I found that most of her solutions to problems were addressed with purchasing her products. It was my understanding that there were inexpensive ways, items from your home & items easily purchased from your local drug store  - which could accomplish the same results as the more expensive remedies & name brands. I did not find the suggestions to be any cheaper than what I was purchasing myself beforehand.  There were some solutions she suggested that worked okay, but I found I was trying too many products, spending more money and not getting the good results stated in the book. <br /> <br />Examples: She says to \\"cleanse\\" before doing certain things like exfoliate - she does not address cleansing. <br /> <br />She suggests that \\"exfoliating\\" will help with the removal of blackheads - but doesn't tell how to remove the blackheads from the face safely without bruising or scarring the skin. <br /> <br />After reading the book I came away with only one or two remedies that worked.   <br /> <br />I would not have purchased this book if I had known the above. <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

Now, I am sure about that, because when I try to fold a piece of paper in half more than eight times, I can no longer fold it, so while he may be right, his conclusion, from the evidence he presents, is only a conjecture. <br /> <br />The book is a conjecture, that social phenomena behave like infectious bacteria.

She has tested these recipes in Europe and has found some interesting substitutes for materials not easily found outside of Japan.<br /><br />If you like Japanese cooking and would like to try to make it at home, this is the best introduction.

As a summa cum laude graduate math major (of some years ago) I expected to enjoy an romp thru some beautiful mathematical ideas. Well, the ideas are there, and Havil is to be commended for gathering some unusual and interesting topics. And much of the extensive mathematical notation is supported with nice numeric examples. However, much of it is not. All too often there are pages of integrals, sums, and products that go happily on without a clue to some of the beautiful things that are happening. The most frustrating example is the \\"proof\\" of Euler's zeta function formula, one of the prettiest pieces of mathematics. I still cannot understand Havil's presentation. (It was thrilling to read the same proof in \\"Prime Obsession\\" by Derbyshire so I know it can be explained with simple algebra.) Also, \\"Gamma\\" appears to be intended to be read in one sitting since it is rarely possible to begin at an advanced chapter. It is assumed that you remember definitions and notations which have appeared long before. To the author's credit, there are occasional backward references by page number, but then, about half of these are frustratingly wrong. Finally, it would be nice to see a copy of the errata for this book. I hope this book appears in a 2nd edition where the level of its presentation is made much more consistent.	2005-10-13

My advice is to be very skeptical and test everything. The scientific (quantum reality/multiple dimension) theory to me is very plausible, and although science is biased towards the nonexistence of God, it's slowly moving to its own realization that there is God, and there is intelligent design. But getting back to the author's observations and subjectiveness, I'm moved by his sincerity and professional work ethic. I wish this was offered hard-bound, but you would do well to just get a copy.	2005-10-13

As always, T.M. Wright is at the top of his game.  This book puts you in a trance with it's smooth prose and mysterious imagery.  T.M. Wright makes the reader work.  And the more you work, the more you uncover.  I loved everything about it.  In a market where horror writers try to top each other with violence and gore, T.M. uses his incredible skills as a wordsmith and storyteller to stand out.  In time, at least within the intelligent horror community, T.M. Wright will always be known as one of horror's pioneers and the most original and effective ghost story writer in history.  Without question, The Eye's of the Carp deserves the Bram Stoker award.	2005-10-13

The word ha'ole for example, has the root 'ha' meaning breath, and the word ole meaning without.  So the word used initially to describe missionaries that came to Hawaii, has the secondary meaning, those who pray without breath.<br /><br />Within this book is an explanation of the ha rite, which uses breath combined with prayer (intention) to generate mana which is sent to your higher self to manifest what you want in your life.  This is a very powerful technique.<br /><br />I have combined what I have gotten from this book and a few other sources, and using my intuition have come up with something very effective.<br /><br />The Huna commandment on page 72 is not to harm another.  So using this technique to interfere with someone's free will would not be appropriate.<br />If you do wish to focus on someone work for their highest good. If you wish to manifest love in your life, you can have a person in mind who seems ideal, but ask for this if they are agreeable on a higher self level or for someone equal or greater.<br /><br />In this book you will find described many concepts such as ho'oponopono, and the concept of the three selves, middle self (ego), lower self, (subconscious or hidden self), and the higher self (superconscious or superego). According to this system you would integrate all these aspects of self, and clear out the blocks or complexes within your lower self so you can manifest through your higher self.<br /><br />Further reading I recommend would be 'Mastering your hidden self' by Serge Sahili King, which also describes the Shamanic principles for creating your own reality.  These were life changing for me. I also highly recommend \\"Go up and work with God' by Vianna Stibal, a healer.  In that book she describes a manifesting ritual from her Huna studies.  An excellent book.<br /><br />Secret Science behind Miracles by Max Freedom Long is a must read book if you want to learn more from the pioneer who discovered what was until then a secret philosphy.a secret philosphy.	2005-10-13

I have been very dissatified with work as of late. I feel like I work hard, I am there for long hours, but have not been as productive as others. Working through the exercises in the book has helped me more then I could have imagined! You have to do the work sheets. It is not a book to just skim through. As a result my goals are more streamline and priorites adjusted and as a result I get out of work earlier. I was spending time doings tasks that I felt were important but in reality were not. I just bought two more for my partners. Note I beleive this is very helpful for women, in particular, who spread themselves too thin and do too much multi-tasking. Women see all the little things at work that need done, do not necessarily delegate, and do those little things that others may not even notice. All of which in the end only waste time. I believe it is good for those work-a-holics who think they need to stay. On your death bed you will not say to yourself I should have spent more time at the office. Thank You.

Assmann writes \\"ancient Egypt is an intellectual and spiritual world that is linked to our own by numerous strands of tradition.\\" He discusses, for example, the influences of works such as \\"The Admonitions of Ipuwer\\" [13th cent.BC]on Bertold Brecht who used parts of it in his play \\"The Caucasian Chalk Circle\\". He explains the most important Egyptian philosophical concept \\"ma'at\\" or \\"connective justice\\" (illustrated in \\"The Eloquent Peasant\\" a Middle Kingdom work but holding \\"for Egyptian civilization in general\\" in terms of the ideas of both Karl Marx and Nietzsche.<br />  Most importantly he shows what the Egyptian state really stood for as opposed to the false images found in Old Testament propaganda that mispresents Eqypt as an oppressive slave state. \\"The Egyptian state.\\" he says, \\"is the implementation of a legal order that precludes the natural supremacy of the strong and opens up prospects for the weak (the 'widows' and 'orphans') that otherwise would not exist.\\"<br />  Unlike many who think that the revolution initiated by Akhenaten perished with him, Assmann presents evidence that its main principles survived in other religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) as well in secular venues from Greek philosophy \\"to the universalist formulas of oun own age as embodied in the physics of Einstein and Heisenberg.\\"<br />It is possible that many of the ideas of \\"Christianity\\" were originally formulated by the Egyptians.<br />  Today we know more about the Ancient Egyptians than ever before so we should \\"attempt to enter into a dialogue with the newly readable messages of ancient Egyptian culture and thus to reestablish them as an integral part of our cultural memory.\\"<br />I have only skimmed the surface of this important book. Anyone who wants to understand ancient Egypt must read this book.\\"	2005-10-13

In any case...<br /><br />This is far from my favorite C J Cherry book...<br /><br />Which is to say it is a very good book, just not one of the top twenty books I've ever read.<br /><br /> Ms. Cherryh is in my opinion the greatest writer living or dead when it comes to culture, and world creating. In this story there are three which are dealt with. Primarily, there is the culture of a quarantined space station, what would make life worth living for young adults in a place where there is no real struggle or getting out. The moral of the story seems to be the role of art, (strangely in this story the art of personal appearance), in society. There is a typical Cherryh disdain for how politics always get in the way of good and talented people doing the right thing.<br /><br />Secondarily, the culture of the planet below is dealt with, including the immortality of the protagonist of the previous story.<br /><br />And finally, the outside universe is dealt with as the paranoid who are afraid of what they don't understand.<br /><br />So if you don't want a story where you have to think, then this is not a story for you. Of course if you don't want to think,  C J Cherryh is probably not the author for you. Try Koonts. Or maybe Matthew Reilly, (both are authors whom I enjoy) depending on how you don't want to think. However if you want to explore the \\"what if\\" side of human interaction, and the shades of gray in character, this is one you might enjoy. I did.	2005-10-13

As potential evidence for this, Ronner shows the amazing similarities between Abraham Lincoln, JFK & Ceasar; and then also between Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy.<br /><br />Then Ronner discusses the great number of \\"end of days\\" prophecies - why there are so many, and potential reasons for why they've all been wrong to date.  Could it be that we're constantly changing our future, and that previous prophecies were merely one of the many potential outcomes for our planet?<br /><br />The scientific evidence for prophetic abilities, as well as information on various \\"prophets/seers\\" is then provided, along with various types of divination techniques.  The question of whether or not everyone has these abilities is then touched on.<br /><br />Last, Ronner shows the amazing power of the mind in creating our experiences/future.  This makes sense given the well-known evidence re: the \\"self fulfilling prophecy\\" - we get what we believe we will get...<br /><br />Overall, I found \\"Seeing Your Future\\" to be an interesting, easy read.  As such, I would highly recommend it to those interested in the \\"paranormal\\" in general, and prophecy/prediction in particular.	2005-10-13

That the 3 act structure is a natural story telling structure, hence it's widespread adoption and success.<br /><br />But he does not preach a strait-jacket of structure. He gives the writer tools to understand how structure can impact the success of story telling. And I have personally found his insights invaluable when understood in that way.	2005-10-13

Obviously the work of a first-time author, CD Payne's Youth in Revolt uneasily lurches along a predictable path to a teenage nerd's ultimate fantasy ending.  Our protagonist, Nick Twisp, begins the story as a fairly standard Oakland dweeb, but in course of the book inexplicably transforms into some kind of clever, manipulative uber-genius sex god. Unfortunately, the transformation never comes across as believable.   <br /> <br />Part of the problem can be traced to the book's structure; Payne chose to write the stories in diary format.  Sometimes, though rarely, this method works for recounting tales.  In this case, Payne's insistence on using overblown vocabulary words makes the character's inner dialogue preposterous.  Nick's writing and speech reflect the voice of a 40 year old man.   <br /> <br />That his friends think and speak in a similar fashion - most of them also at 14 years of age - negates any semblance of verisimilitude.  In Payne's imaginary world people fall into two categories: brilliant and borderline retarded.  How could Nick's nitwit parents produce two kids who are so obviously morally, intellectually and emotionally superior in every way?  <br />  <br />At times the writing is laugh out loud hilarious.  Upon meeting a beautiful Indian girl, Nick inquires about the meaning of her name.  She responds eloquently (falling into the friend category so she's super-smart) and asks about his name's origin.  His droll response: it means a cut received while shaving.  Likewise, many of the incidents that occur - especially in the first 3rd of the book - caused me explosive fits of laughter too.  Even the middle portion of the book offers a few deliciously funny turns.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book deviates from the established characters and tone in the third act.  Nick's transformation into a wholly different person for the last third of the book means that much of his dorky fumbling and ridiculous overly convoluted machinations and day-dreamishideas slip away, along with his charm.  Suddenly, he's able to outwit everybody and essentially turns into a puppetmaster/do-gooder.   <br /> <br />Maybe Payne wanted to redeem the character's earlier failings?  Maybe he wanted to make us like Nick as some poor kid who hadn't been allowed to flourish under the harshness of his divorced parent's constant condemnation and unreasonable rules?  Whatever the reason, Payne's decision to morph Nick from underdog to Keyser Soze in training doesn't fly.  Nick's efforts culminate in ways that are too pat and many open arcs remain unclosed as if for a sequel.  Did Payne just lose steam? It's not as if Nick grows as a person either.  He changes, no doubt - becoming more cunning and sneaky - but he never matures into a character that has learned from past mistakes.  Payne's character goes from wild, almost cute, paranoid teen to hedonistic, mendacious sociopath.  Maybe that was the intention. If so, the book's extended climax (at least 50 pages), doesn't deliver on Nick's transition either.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, the ending seems more like every teen's dream come true but not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the book.  It's like Payne wanted a fairy tale ending tacked onto a story that's full of lies, deception, crimes and sex.   <br /> <br />Overall, Youth in Revolt amuses with sharp lines and a few very amusing incidents, but the tone and events in the book - sort of a poor man's Matt Ruff or Christopher Moore - never feels right with the supposed ages of the characters.  Suspension of disbelief only goes so far and then the comically absurd just becomes tedious writing by someone trying to prove to the reader how clever or smart he and his characters are.	2005-10-13

This is one of the all-time classic series of comic books, reprinted in a beautiful new edition. The story is good (although Claremont's writing would improve in later issues) and the art, by Dave Cockrum, is simply stunning. And, of course, these stories served to introduce the most influential and popular Marvel characters since Spider-Man in the early 60s.<br /><br />So why the three stars? I was comparing this book to my original comics and I realized that the coloration had been changed significantly. This may seem like a minor point -- the pencil work and inking is, obviously, exactly the same as it was in the originals -- but the choice of colors used in this book does a lot to determine the \\"atmosphere\\" of the stories, and in this reprint, the atmosphere is a lot brighter, featuring noticeably more primary colors than the original comic books.<br /><br />In some cases -- e.g. the character Colossus -- a lot of subtle detail, created by the use of different shades of the same color, has been eliminated. The space-opera scenes are a lot more \\"cartoony\\" looking, with bright blue replacing the subtle blue-grey that was originally used for the exterior of the spaceships. Throughout the stories, panels that were previously colored in subtle earthy shades are now done in bright primary colors or some other high-contrast color scheme that completely changes the impression the artwork makes on one's eyes.<br /><br />This may seem like a lot of nit-picking, and I realize that the re-coloring was probably a mechanical requirement for reprinting the stories in full-color (rather than four-color), but I don't feel like the changes are really insignificant. Compared to the original comics, this book looks like a Saturday morning cartoon show. Considering that this is an extremely expensive deluxe edition, it seems to me like Marvel could have spent a little more time to get it closer to the originals.	2005-10-13

First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks.  There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc.  This is our Second Chance on Earth.  No tribulation.  This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly.  Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian.  Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life.  It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message.  Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it.  But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies).  My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing.

It changed my diet and now, thanks to the ongoing information from the Weston A. Price Foundation [...] I feel healthier than I ever have!<br /><br />He explored how the healthiest people on the planet ate, how it affected their teeth and overall health.  He drops hints at the incredibly exciting life he had, like mentioning that he and his wife met a cannibal chief on the Pacific Islands, travelled to Alaska, and climbed the Swiss Alps.  And he found that age old dietary wisdom beats modern convenience foods hands down.<br /><br />One unexpected find that I've shared with some dentist friends is that he had a special diet that stopped the progression of cavities and actually re calcified the deteriorating teeth.<br /><br />The only flaw in the book was that I think he overlooked the very important role of salt in the native's diets.  They used it to preserve their food, and those who ate modern foods ate much less, since it was canned.<br /><br />Overall, a very good and important book!  I'd recommend reading it with Andre Voisin's book, \\"Soil, Grass, and Cancer\\" as together they paint an amazing picture of what is happening to the human race.	2005-10-13

This book paints an interesting picture of a world where healers are second class citizens. The problem, however, is that the picture isn't very deep.<br /><br />Blumlein falls into the habit early in the book of waiting until the last possible moment to explain a new term he's using. Yes, it's interesting that there are Unerrants and Orts and melis and musk, but it would have been MORE interesting if he explained it the first time he mentioned it rather than forcing me to reread the chapter.<br /><br />He also tends to misuse pronouns, especially in dialog, (When you say \\"she said\\", tell me which SHE said it!) leading to confusing passages for the reader.<br /><br />As for the ending, rather than finding it grand or mythical, I found it rather nonsensical and weird.<br /><br />The concept of this book is very good and well thought out, however the excecution of it leaves something to be desired.	2005-10-13

I expected to read about the lives of the women who were in the \\"hand-picked\\" bookclub in Iran, and how they may have used literature to overcame the struggles faced by women in the middle-east.    Instead, the book is more a memoir of the author's life. The many friends, co-wokers, family and women she writes about remind me of someone discussing their trophies.  She proves over and over again that her NEED to teach is more to force her own narcassic viewpoints rather than encouraging students to draw their own conclusions.  How sad for those studying under her.        Although the book touches on the lives of the members of the group, the author spends much of her time sharing personal stories of what it was like for her during her years as a rebellious, demonstrating young college woman NOT IN THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT IN THE UNITED STATES while attending college. Instead of blending the use of various great literature pieces into the story to show how the women used such works as \\"Lolita\\" to help them cope with their lives, she ran on and on and on with excerpts from various works, and did not relate them to current problems in the Middle East.       I felt at times the author was using this book as a means for her to come to terms with herself and how her own life had changed rather than enlighten the public of the struggles in the Middle East.        If someone has little knowledge of the struggles of women who are opressed in the Middle East,then you may enjoy this book.  If you, however have a general knowledge from other books, then I am almost certain you will find this book long, drawn out and boring.	2005-10-13

This book is an answer to a question many people have been avoiding all their lives.  And when you finally develop the ability to ask it to yourself, Sartre provides his suggested answer for you, though it may not be the answer you wanted.<br /><br />The premise of the main play, \\"No Exit\\", is that many people have chosen to exist in misery, even when the exit to that misery presents itself clearly.  For these people, there is \\"no exit\\".  Their existance is defined by their misery.  If they make the concious decision to exit, then they have nothing to live for.<br /><br />All four plays are written in non-pretentious and easy to understand styles, unlike many philisophical writings.  They don't require a great deal of effort to read or understand.  In fact, they are quite enjoyable and I found myself reading each play many times before moving on to the next one.<br /><br />Don't expect to feel uplifted about the state of humanity while reading these plays, however.  Sartre's message about human existance can be a dismal one.  It is quite helpful, though, to come to terms with the fact that many of our fellow humans are just puzzled about their lives, and sharing a social existance with these people can be precarious to your own search for meaning.	2005-10-13

I'm in agreement with some of the other's who've reviewed this book here. I don't think it's very useful to someone like me who's been playing the game since the mid 80s, but this book has its charm, and it is very useful for the highschool kid who's been stuck with the task of DMing for the first time and needs some advice. Sure, there are useful section on cities, NPCs, prestige class creation, etc, but the bulk of the book is an aid for those who need to hone their Dming skills. I'll admit, it made reassess my own style as I read it. One thing I found to be really important about this book is that it specifically states, several times, that you don't have to DM one specific way, that FUN is the goal. It's all about putting the FUN back into the game. It tells those of us, who've become set in our ways, to step back and ask ourselves if our players are enjoying the games we run. This is one of few DnD books of late that hasn't been choke full of prestige classes, feats, spells and other fluff. I recommend it to everyone if for no other reason that it makes you think, instead of offering you a pile of junk your players will get pumped on and you'll have to find a way to incorporate in your game.	2005-10-13

They were called communists, criminals and freeloaders by the president and members of congress during the worst years of the depression. President Hoover used US troops commanded by General Douglas MacArthur to drive them out of the city and the American voters were so outraged the incident helped carry FDR to the White House that fall. It would still be several years before the bonus was paid but the saga of the bonus army paved the way for the GI Bill of Rights and provided a model for every mass protest held in the capital since. <br />    Dickson and Allen provide a stirring narrative with an all star cast that includes Herbert Hoover, George Patton, Douglas MacArthur, Andrew Mellon, Dwight Eisenhower and J Edgar Hoover. <br />    The Bonus Army has faded from view over time and this worthy book brings an important era in or history back into focus.	2005-10-13

Since this is his best known work I knew I had to check it out. It is a very engaging book about Cuban brothers trying to make it in the US during the 50's Mambo craze. The story is very entertaining as many memorable characters both fictional and real Cuban musicians from the period are introduced.<br />The story while full of colorful epsiodes is ultimately tragic as the brothers age and life takes it's toll on each of them in very different ways.<br />Hijuelos uses sexual imagery and descriptions of food to create a steamy  intensity to the story with great effect. That said the lurid sexual descriptions cited by many other reviewers may turn off some readers. While I was enjoying the book enough to overlook this, there are times when he does rely too much on this device and the novel starts to feel like a guilty pleasure. If you are OK with that type of writing then there are rewards to be had in the characterizations and plot. If you cannot stomach the hard-core sexual references that are integral to this book then stay away and try one of his other novels.	2005-10-13

I read some ten to twenty reviews on this book here before buying it, and I've looked through the twenty-odd reviews that have appeared since, and it's clear that there's quite a partisan division in opinion. It's what you'd expect, I guess, from a book that is pretty open about all sorts of facts of life, the classical-music context notwithstanding.  <br /> <br />The book is very brave, and may turn out to be foolish, but it is a good read. It's not an in-depth analysis of the problems of classical music today, as some point out in their criticisms. But the inclusion of material on these issues certainly illuminated the very touching and human story that Blair tells. I don't think classical music is alone in the way it has disappointed some of its practitioners; one could probably find similar tales amongst the \\"freeway flyer\\" part-time faculty who teach a lot of the college classes in this country. I think one question that Blair's story raises is how divorced from reality our whole career-oriented culture is. I see college students every day (not as a freeway-flyer, but as a reasonably content full-time faculty member) and wonder about the heavy and ill-informed career decisions they are being asked to make without ever having had much experience of the real world.  <br /> <br />This book needs to be viewed as the memoir that it is, with the understanding that memoirs are going to be subjective and personal, but filled with a lot of data about how life is lived and experienced by people in situations very different from our own. Of course, a lot of the reviewers here are in situations that aren't very different from Blair's, and maybe that explains a lot of the vitriol.	2005-10-13

With language that is succinct and precise, he takes us on the ultimate surreal journey; the journey of the questions of late middle age.  Gratuitously, Coetzee gives us a clue to the dream journey by calling one main character \\"Marijana,\\" a word/name whose resemblance to the hallucinogen of virtually the same spelling but for one letter is inescapable.  This device allows Coetzee to do a unique and wonderful thing.  It allows him to have an entire book that represents one man's conversation with himself, complete with graphic images. <br /> <br />His protagonist \\"Paul\\" is a retired photographer, who is living a nice and full life at the age of 60.  Due to a fantastic accident on his bicycle, he has recovered.  But he has not recovered completely.  His knee was totally shattered and his leg was amputated just above the knee.  It is as a result of this condition, that he hires a nurse. <br /> <br />Yet, we must remember that the conversations are all with Paul himself.  Whatever the characters say or do are all written by Paul.  He writes the lines.  He creates the images.  All in the book is constructed or written by Paul.  And those constructions are specifically targeted to answer a very difficult trifurcated question.  \\"What to do with the rest of my life?\\" <br /> <br />The question has 3 potential answers.  The first is to go back to his prior life as best he can, given his condition.  The second is to sit in his gloomy room till he dies a natural death, nothing ventured, nothing lost; so to speak.  The third is to choose to self-terminate and save himself the pain and anxiety.  These are the choices Paul has to select from.  There are no others.  And through this phantasmagoria, Paul investigates the inevitable question that faces all of us when we are `struck down' for the first time at some point in life. <br /> <br />The book is written with extreme aplomb and illustrates some of the deepestquestions of life.  Have I been a contributor?  Have I lived a full life?  Have I lived a righteous life?  Have I accomplished anything by which to be remembered?  All of us at some point have the opportunity to ask these questions.  Almost all of us will at some point, have this conversation with ourselves. <br />	2005-10-13

Almost alone at a retreat in North Carolina, one week has stretched into three, but the real world is calling again and they must reluctantly part ways.<br /><br />Just as they reach the airport, Callie gets a phone call from Stella Gold.  Her husband Eli has just been shot by a sniper and is in surgery.  Before loosing consciousness, he specifically asked for the two of them to come.  Since Eli is such a good friend, they drop everything and rush to his bed side.<br /><br />A PI, Callie wants to figure out what happened to Eli.  The only clue is a warning from someone named Nadine.  When Eli and Stella's condo is searched, it is further proof that someone is after him.  Where might he have hidden his notes?  And why did Eli request Tom's presence?<br /><br />As this series has progressed, the plots have only gotten strong, and this book is no exception.  It starts with a bang and keeps right on going.  Every time an answer comes, it only leaves more questions.  Yet Callie and Tom keep digging, getting themselves further and further in trouble.  While some things seemed obvious a little early on, there are still several nice twists along the way that keep the reader guessing.<br /><br />Fans of the series will be happy to learn that Tom is a very active part of this book instead of only a presence like in previous entries.  In fact, we even get to learn what he does, finally.  His relationship with Callie continues to grow as she continues to move on from her husband's death.  In fact, one of the strong points of the series is watching Callie finally truly deal with her grief.<br /><br />The writing style is still a little rough, keeping the reader a little more at bay by telling instead of showing.  It's not a big problem, however, and I found myself staying up too late reading every night to see what would happen in the next chapter.<br /><br />The only problem with this book is the cliffhanger ending.  Even though I saw it coming (I've read the back of the next book already), it still left me wanting to pick up the next book right away.  Which isn't really a bad thing at all.<br /><br />With a strong plot and great characters, this Christian mystery series is wonderful entertainment.is book is the cliffhanger ending.

This book is exactly what its title says. If you are new to relief carving, you might think that realistic relief carving involves simply in the carving half round.

The book has several simple projects in the beginning to help you master the basic principles. Then you can carve a very nice nautical scene which is detailed step by step with ample photos.

The book, though attributed to a single author, is actually a collection of short magazine articles written by several contributors, and gives a reasonably broad set of views on the windfalls and pratfalls of dealing in this market.   Though sympathetic to the marque and the pleasures of ownership, the collective authors lead one to the conclusion that Ferrari ownership is not for people unwilling to spend thousands of dollars on, say, a periodic valve adjustment.   Another view that is commmon among the collective authors is that ownership of depreciated (and hopefully future appreciating) Ferraris is not about everyday driving, but is about the pleasure of savoring the fact of ownership, and an occasional drive into town on a sunny weekend afternoon.   Anything more is such a risk to the value of the car that only persons having very large financial resources to devote to hobby cars would actually accumulate substantial miles on such a vehicle.    <br />Properly sobered by this information, somebody like me can decide to invest in one of these cars fully ready for the likely financial consequences of the decision.	2005-10-13

The whole book is contrived to give Richard, the protagonist, chances to lecture other characters, friend and foe, as well as the reader. <br /> <br />The book is not without its good points, but you've got to wade through a lot of sermonizing to get to them. <br /> <br />It sounds like Goodkind has heard this complaint, but doesn't agree with it.  Well, its his series and he can do what he want's with it, but if he stays in this vein he'll be losing one of his following pretty soon.	2005-10-13

All the characters in this book are actually real and I love the fact that the main heroine and hero had to learn to accept their faults and differences and that what they wanted wasn't always what they were going to get and that in itself is real love loving someone with faults and all. <br /> <br />Unlike Feehans prevous novels where the Carpathian males \\"conforted\\" their lifemates, the major premise the author conveys throughout the entire book is that Carpathian males are not human, that they have are a different race with a different set of moral societal standards therefore it is impossible to judge them by human standards because they are not human. <br /> <br />In this novel the Carpathia males portrayed were very dark, very dangerous, and very scandalous. Feehan exhibits more closely the torture carpathian males suffer were they are close to converting to vampire. She does a great job conveying their desperate anguish and dilemma and you actually for this first time see why finding a lifemate is so important to the male speicies of the Carpathian race. <br /> <br />Although there some reviews on this book who felt that the hero was a \\"rapist\\" I strongly disagree with that assumption. At no time did the hero ever actually force the heroine into forceful sexual relations he does however betray the heroine with a choice that almost shatters the complete trust of his lifemate, which causes him almost to lose her love and faith in him however the hero wins the trust of his lifemate by understanding her cultural differences and appreciating her choices and most importantly bending his domineering ways so that there can find a middle ground a necessary trait in a male and female relationship.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, Dark Secret revealed the secret of Carpathian history not really discussed in the other prevous books and we actually go somewhere with the mysterous woman who the vampires are trying to find. In addition the author communicates to the reader that no male is perfect even a Carpathian male, yet with understanding and patience you will encounter the greatest gift of all: A powerful love. <br />	2005-10-13

This monograph is the second to exhibit the work he has become famous for - a bare bones Northwest vernacular that owes as much to his Pennsylvania roots as it does to the Pacific Northwest.  It is readily apparent that Cutler studied under Louis Kahn in the exacting details he demands in all his projects.  He now has the luxury to pick and choose his clients which have include Bill Gates.  You get a small glimpse of the Gates estate in the Entry Turnaround in Medina, Washington.  He and Peter Bohlin worked on the project together, setting up a sawmill on the site to cut the recycled timber to their specifications.  As Cutler once said, I never look at the same detail twice, re-examining the methods and materials of construction anew in each project he undertakes.<br /><br />With the introduction of Bruce Anderson to the firm, he has begun to investigate pre-fabricated housing in the form of the Lindal Cedar Home, but you can see that it is the unique individual homes which he relishes.  He experimented with rammed-earth construction in the Residence at Meteor Vineyards in Napa Valley, creating a unique marbled finish; but it is projects like the Schmidt Residence that bear his signature in the intricate woodwork and metal connections.  This book provides you with a short but thorough look into several of the projects, illustrating that James Cutler is one of the leading architects of his generation.	2005-10-13

But, although it's a great book this is not a must-have... its simply great-to-have. <br /> <br />I gave 4 stars and maybe it should be 4.5 but not 5 because it lack a little of detail and it contain very few photos.

If you have an above average I.Q. and can work through this book without the need of personal instruction, this book alone could save you the $2k that others pay for live classes (in my opinion, if you need to spend $2k to attend live classes in order to score well on the LSAT, you really need to reconsider law school because you'll most likely be winnowed out during the first year anyway- just because they let you in doesn't mean they're convinced you should become a lawyer).

I first encounterd here Philosophy of Logics several decades back and was impressed with its breadth, which is what I needed at the tie, but not its depth (which is what I needed later). In many ways, this book exhibits the same strengths and limitations.  First of all, there is a competent tour around contemporary pro and anti-scientism positions.  Let's face it, this is a quite a task in itself.  Secondly, there is the critique of the various positions.  This is where the limitations are found.  The book really does not add anything new to the debate, nor turnover the ground in novel ways. For instance, the chapers on the law and science and univeristy capitalism and science could have been much condensed - and more cogent material is available in some of the priamry sources.  The overall thesis of the work is that common sense has some cultuer dependencies, some knowledge dependencies and some practice (or pragmatic in the technology sense) dependencies. Hard and fast judgements are therefore defeasible and opend to revisions, but the overall success of science in explaining and predicting a range of phenomena lends it a substantial objectivity - in terms of there being a body of knowledge.  Most readers will agree with this position but arguing the epistemological nitty gritty is entirely different when it is looked over with the eye of a professional sceptic.  It is at this level that the book begins to fade, falling back on appeals to value laden ideas about success and common sense.  The argument is reminiscient of Hao Wang's support for what he called 'substantial factualism' - an appealing common sense thesis but difficult to justify philosophically without begging the question.  Unfortunately the admirable breadth of the book is not matched in depth on this point.	2005-10-12

Though God created something out of nothing, the artist uses that which already exists, and shapes it into a new form. This purely aesthetic creative function is one of the central attributes that separates man from other living creatures, and when the new forms are used to glorify God, a special union takes place between the artist and his Creator. It is this particular form of imagery that Pope John Paul II addresses, giving this slim booklet special meaning for those whose endeavors are in the religious art genre.<br /><br />Some of the finest art known to mankind was inspired by faith (and much of it sponsored by the Catholic Church). These masterpieces are a far cry from what sometimes passes for art in our present age of quick fortune and fame, and that receives attention from the media and galleries, where \\"being outrageous\\" has often replaced skill and true inspiration, as well as beauty that has transforming power. He writes that an artist must not have a \\"craving for cheap popularity\\", but labor for something much greater, and \\"enrich the cultural heritage\\" of the nations and humanity. As Dostoevsky wrote in The Idiot, \\"Beauty will save the world.\\"<br /><br />Pope John Paul II speaks of how the Church needs art, to bring the invisible mystery of the Gospels into form and color, as well as how artists need the Church, which offers \\"a horizon especially rich in inspiration.\\" Christian artists will appreciate this essay on the relationship between faith and beauty, and their responsibility to achieve their highest goals.

Amazing, mesmerizing; a tasty dish of words, a sense of humor to offset the many injuries the major characters suffer.  I can tell Pat Conroy LIVES.  His way with words is so brilliant, so funny, so deep.  He never turns away from the darkest images, such as the suggestion of incest when he talks about his little girls' behinds. His subject matter is not new: Life is funny, life is terrifying, people love, people hate, people have &#34;inappropriate feelings&#34; and do horrible things to each other.  Yet most of us survive.  Conroy is clearly a survivor, and can tell this story of horror and passionate love of family because he knows what happens when the twistedness of a parent and the shackles of blood ties to family and home combine in a suicidal mess.  Conroy puts all this together in his perhaps sixth book,  I consider his masterpiece. Conroy has recently published his most revealing book, The Losing Season, so that we know that portraits of his parents, his brothers, and his own profound misery and joy spring from the fountains of his younger life.  The reader may disapprove of self-revelation, although it is well-disguised in &#34;Prince of Tides&#34;.  Perhaps this is why it is his grandest feat of story-telling. I refused to read &#34;Prince&#34; for years and years, having seen it in bookstore windows, flying rapidly away with each ding of the cash register.  How could a bestseller be anything but something to read on the beach or the bus?  Finally, someone forced me to borrow it, and it was at least a three-day, non-stop love affair with Conroy's humor, grief, profundity.  A volcano of ideas, a superior intellect comparable to the best writers of our time.   Many people have published books, and some are fabulously entertaining.  But a select few are recognized by a large audience as genius (Roth, Atwood, Irving, LeGuin, Kesey, Winterson, to name some popular authors who are also read as serious writers).  Conroy should be among these supreme talents, and &#34;Prince of Tides&#34; may well be recognized as his most original, complex, and best.	2005-10-12

The edition appears to be 1976 and it is bound in a high-quality grained black leatherette, not burgundy leather.   <br /> <br />In all other respects, the binding is heritage quality.  It will lie flat on any page, and the detailing is meticulous: gold leaf on the outside of the pages, gold braid ornamentation on the inside edges of the covers, burgundy and gold heavy thread at the top and bottom of the spine stitching. <br /> <br />The paper and ink are top quality.  I could not believe this was a full large-print bible when I picked it up.  It is light and only 1.5 inches thick, so you can read it while holding it in your hand.  But although the pages are thin, you can barely see the print on the converse of a printed page (although you can see through empty pages to the next page).  The printing is crisp and clear, and will not smudge.  There is a ribbon attached to the binding to be used as a bookmark <br /> <br />The typeface is a traditional serif proportional font, either medium or bold.  Notes (cross-references, alternate meanings, etc.) are done in smaller light sans serif typeface at the end of each verse.  Each verse is indented, but there is a symbol to show the original paragraphs.  The pull weight of the pages is very high.  (I.e. the pages can't be pulled out and should not fall out, very important in a flat-lying book.) <br /> <br />I have found this Bible easy to read in every respect.  There are three nice extras:  a basic concordence at the back, four thick coated double-side pages of traditional family Bible recording matters (marriage, children, deaths etc.)in the very front, and four similar pages of excellent maps at the very back. <br /> <br />I don't *need* large print, but it really increases reading comfort and saves eyestrain for anyone without perfect vision.  I have had it for 6 months and so far it appears to be durable -- mine looks like new, with no torn pages, smudges,or scratches. <br /> <br />Actually, even if you would be happy with a hard-bound book volume or paperback, you might be happier with this one, due to its durability, its ability to lie flat, and its light weight.  You certainly won't get a leather-bound Bible of this general quality for @ $14 (in fact, you aren;t going to get a fine leather binding for $14 no matter what's inside). <br /> <br />In summary, this Bible is a phenomenal value if you want a top-quality, well-made Bible to read frequently, which looks like a traditional, expensive Bible.   <br />	2005-10-12

Standing alone this is excellent literature.  Such angst over word usage as I have read in prior reviews seems an immature reaction to the very inconsequential.  I will simply state this, I have NEVER read novels that so tightly weaves me with the main protaganists.  I feel like I know these people.  Other popular series may have great writing, plots, pace, intricacies, but none connect the reader so intimately with it's characters.  Disclaimers regarding this series' length should be given but each book and especially the first deserves a review on it's own merit.  That being said IMHO the first three books of this series could stand alone as the greatest fantasy trilogy ever written and I have read most.  And this is written by one who admits to having become greatly frustrated at this series protracted length and lack of resolution of major plots.	2005-10-12

I'm bothered by the number of typos in it, as well as that much of the information is very vague, but I do feel it's helping me plan my itinerary.

First of all, the book comes wrapped in plastic, so you can't check it out first - a real downside, I think. <br /> <br />It's a neat idea, and I'd hoped the book would be a real aid for knitting brainstorming and planning.  Unfortunately, it's heavily weighted towards the figure-outline design pages, which are only good for designing sweaters.  I'd like to have something to prompt accessory ideas, and more of the knitting-journal features.  There are only 12 spaces for \\"things I've made\\" entries, and a handful of \\"projects I want to knit\\" require a full page each. <br /> <br />The yarn inventory page is a neat idea, but, as previous reviewers have said, I don't know how well the book would handle having bits of yarn taped inside it. <br /> <br />The journal would be made much better with more project pages, and maybe some pages for a wish list without pictures.  But it's still fun to use, and I'm beginning to keep track of projects - I'm just very disappointed that I'd run out of space quickly if I tried to enter every gift-project I've made in the past year.	2005-10-12

It is presented in a very logical way and easy to follow while getting to the very heart of possible back pain and the exact way to treat it. Even if you are, for some reason, anti-Yoga, this book shows stretches that are directly related to having a healthy and strong back.  I would add to the title that the book can also prevent back problems, and this can be as IMPORTANT as ever. PREVENTION as opposed to treating is a blessing and if you have that situation, read this book. Amazingly simple for those unfamiliar to Yoga. Again, A GREAT READ	2005-10-12

Indeed, his entire preface is a plea to take him seriously even though he's writing for the popular market because his contemporary scholars would reject his work.   <br /> <br />He gets a lot of stuff wrong.  For example, he has a photo of Ahkenaten sitting on his throne with the hands of the solar disk Aten holding anks to him and this is labelled as being an image of the Aten.  The figure is most certainly not the deity, but the pharaoh.  He spends pages on animal worship and completely ignores the Apis bull.  He makes connections where there are none (between Osiris's coffin being caught in a tree and a type of vegetation worship for which we have no evidence).  If you want to know about Egyptian mythology, look elsewhere.	2005-10-12

Mix Cellini is a former abused child with the attendant potential for violence.  He is obsessed with mass murderer Reggie Christie (who really did live in Notting Hill) and with supermodel Nerissa Nash.  Nerissa has her own fantasies about the boy next door.  Gwendolyn Chawcer, an octogenarian who rents a flat to Mix Cellini, constantly remembers her own great love, a doctor who attended her dying mother fifty years earlier.  The plot interweaves between these characters and their obsessions, finally culminating in a tragic but satisfying ending for two characters and greater maturity and self-knowledge for the third.<br /><br />The settings add to the pleasure of the plot twists.  London's Notting Hill is a crowded, cosmopolitan area with many neighborhoods ranging from posh to slum, and Gwendolyn Chawcer's crumbling, dust-filled mansion is an appropriately creepy, even haunted, center for the mystery's unfolding. There are also many lesser characters whose personalities and observations add to the story and help illuminate the main plot.<br /><br />Thirteen Steps Down is Rendell at her finest.	2005-10-12

To understand current events, it is essential to understand the historical context from which today's political environment has sprung.  It was interesting to me how the author distanced the \\"intellectual\\" movement from the right wing social conservatives of today.  All political parties are made up of uncomfortable aliases and the present day Republican party is no exception to this rule.  The author makes the necessary distinctions between that which is important to libertarians, traditional conservatives, and neoconservatives. I would especially recommend this book to anyone who is baffled by today's brand of conservative political thought.	2005-10-12

Gifts are broken into 1) Manifestation (sign gifts - 1 Cor 12-14; Acts 2) 2) Ministry (equipping gifts - Eph 4) & 3) Motivational (every-Christian-gifts - Rom 12). <br /> <br />Written in a style anyone can use. <br /> <br />Inventories are great and surprisingly accurate for the limited number of questions used. <br /> <br />Warnings regarding misuse of spiritual gift impulses are very helpful (e.g. a \\"teaching\\" gift can incline a person to feel they are always right). <br /> <br />Application into the arena of employment is a bit excessive and beyond the scope of biblical applications for spiritual gifts.  Better to do a Myers-Briggs or some other personality profile for that endeavor.	2005-10-12

For example, the authors devote pages to discussing the \\"Zone of Proximal Development,\\" a concept central to understanding Vygotsky's contributions to learning theory, but never bother to explain or define it for the reader.  Moreover, the authors have a political ax to grind.  Fired up by true revolutionary zeal, they want to show that Vygotsky's ideas are thoroughly Marxian and can't be translated into any other context. Reading the book has something of the feeling of being invited to a seminar on financial planning and then discovering that the seminar is a poorly disguised infomercial for an expensive and unremunerative annuity.  Readers searching for a lucid introduction to Vygotsky should look elsewhere.	2005-10-12

Like others, i was not blown away by FC when I read it -- the first time.  But last month when time was ticking down to the publishing date for Breath of Snow and Ashes, i thought i would give it a re-read (normally i start the entire series over again, but i think i can resite most of the first few books by now...) I have to say, reading Fiery Cross the 2nd time -- i actually liked it much better than the first time.  I felt i got more out of it and it led me right into this book, so i am glad i re-read it.  <br />   <br />Breath of Snow and Ashes was great, and as others have said nearly as good as the first books.  I enjoyed Brianna coming into her own as a woman and her struggle to keep some the 20th century in her life.   It was good to see some excitement again with Claire and see Jamie continue to show his love and commitment.   I was very glad to see Ian back, he too is one of my favorite characters.    <br /> <br />The growth in Roger was some of the best part of the book and clever on Ms Gabaldon's part because it happened casually and deep into the book, you recognized he was finally comfortable in the past and has started to become Jamie's equal well, except maybe in the love scenes.. but what are you gonna do, Jamie and Claire are pushing 60, how much more bodice ripping can they do? <br /> <br />I purposely did not read any reviews until after i finished the book, so it was mixed feelings for me when it ended -- glad there was more, but kind of miffed as i read it til nearly the end believeing this was the last book.  Like others, i kept waiting for sample scenes i had read on line over the last couple of years.   But, ok the trade off of 1 or 2 more books -- totally worth it.   <br /> <br />Thank you Ms Gabaldon for a great read, thanks for tieing up some loose ends and bringing us right up to the Revolution, very clever.  Claire knows it is coming, Jamie knows it coming and we know it is coming.  Now I cant wait tosee who they meet along the way to freedom.  Make it happen soon!!	2005-10-12

At a time of growing anti-Semitism (the first edition was written in 1926 and an update was published in Paris in 1937) and an immigration crisis affecting Germany as countless refugees poured into Berlin from the East, Roth--himself a Jew from Galicia, the easternmost part of the former Austrian empire--creates a sympathetic yet clearsighted portrait of contemporary Jewish life. In the process he effectively responds to all the stereotypes and libels heaped on East European Jews. For the contemporary reader, however, what is most affecting about this portrait is Roth's ability to convey a panorama of Jewish life on the brink of destruction. Though no one (except maybe Hitler) could have predicted, even in 1937, the extent of the devastation that would be visited on European Jewry, Roth's writing in this book serves as an indelible and moving memorial to a civilization that would soon disappear forever. It must therefore count among the first books in what would now be called \\"Holocaust literature,\\" and one of the most meaningful works of protest literature--protest against the stereotypes that reduced Jews to objects of scorn and contempt; protest against the violence that would ensue from these stereotypes--of all time. Michael Hofmann's understated and articulate translation of this poignant, heartbreaking little book is a tremendous service for English-language readers. It fills in a vital space in the emerging image of Joesph Roth, a writer finally receiving his due in the precincts of European modernism, and it should be read by everyone interested in good writing and the problems of 20th century history.	2005-10-12

I loved the character of Jack and I couldn't wait till the end to see how the story ended.

This was a book that I really wanted to like, but I found the entire premise and content a little too 'precious' for my tastes. As a devoted tea drinker, I was hoping to find some new ideas for what to serve up to go with my afternoon break -- instead, while some of the stories and touches of humor are funny, the ingredients were just a bit too odd for me to contemplate. Too, the book gets overly cute in spots, and while I do admire the author's stand on vegantarism, his self-effacing manner really begins to grate after about the fifth time that he mentions that he's trying not to be self-promoting. Hm-hmmm -- and what about that big sticker on the cover informing me of the latest cd release? It's nice for a once through, but I won't be adding it to my pernament collection.	2005-10-12

I gave Passion a re-read, skimming the painful sex scenes, and the romance was just so-so. There was potential but without the heat of the 'love` scenes 'Passion` would not stand out in any way. <br /> <br />I felt no love between the h/h and Passion had a doormat mentality. The language was even too course for me, and I consider myself a jaded erotica/romance reader. LV needs to apply the use of a thesaurus on her next efforts. There are other words for the female genitalia than the \\"c\\" word which was used ad nauseam. <br /> <br />Mark, our hero extraordinaire sums the book up quite well when he and his brother have a particularly stimulating conversation. They have a long standing agreement they shall marry any woman who can 'take` the entirety of their massive male appendages. How romantic!  <br /> <br />For an erotic read hotter than 'Passion` WITH the romance read 'A Lady's Pleasure` by Renee Bernard.	2005-10-12

Well, Dayton Duncan spent a couple of years visiting those American counties that still meet the definition of frontier -- less than two people per square mile.<br /><br />In Miles From Nowhere, Duncan sheds light on what it means to live alone, really alone, no neighbors in sight or in small communities where there is no \\"next town over.\\"  There are quite a few counties in the mid-west and far west that meet the Census Bureau definition and the author provides an excellent sampling of what makes people stay or in some case move here.<br /><br />The place stories are sometimes fascinating and also interesting.  One area of Nevada was the fallout zone for early nuclear tests -- chosen because it was almost empty.  Duncan explores some of the people who lived under where the white ash fell and explores their continuing health problems as well as their exasperation with an unresponsive government.<br /><br />In Montana, there are still one-room schools where teachers live in trailers at the school site and teach one to ten kids from an attendance area measured in the hundreds or thousands of square miles.  There are people in the mountains of Washington and Oregon who pack their cars with a week's worth of provisions in case they break down because that's how long it could take someone else to happen upon their stalled vehicle.  And in Love County Texas, a county with under 1,000 people, the local elections are decided by feuds and family grudges that separate people into warring camps for elected offices which hold no real power and have no real money to spend.<br /><br />I found a peak into these lives and stories fascinating and couldn't put the book down.  Duncan has a way of getting these folks to open up and treats them matter-of-factly in a manner which allows the stories to speak for themselves.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book that opens up a part of America that almost all of the rest of us will only ever drive through while considering it empty.  Its not all empty, in valleys and nooks and up miles of dirt trails and in other hide-a-ways live some of us who are Miles From Nowhere and live a life the rest of us would have a difficult time enduring.ly ever drive through while considering it empty.

I enjoyed the medical aspects of the story, but as a few others mentioned, there were a few too many characters to keep track of. One thing that I think may hurt this book some is that the beginning, to me was very slow, and involved two characters that we did not see much of further on in the story. I also was very confused by the early chapter that had Jim Summers and his girlfriend Sophia at a conference. A few chapters later Jim is trying to get a date with a co-worker, and I'm wondering what happened to Sophia? I kept expecting her to reappear and she never did.	2005-10-12

I am a die hard fan of Firefly and, as such, I grabbed this book as soon as I heard about it. The cancellation of the show left me wanting more. Essays dissecting the show? What the heck. Could be fun.    But, by and large, it isn't.    The book starts off promising enough. There is an essay that talks about the look and feel of the show from a filmmaking point of view, and that's pretty cool. Also interesting is the examination of the episode \\"Objects in Space\\" (my personal favorite) as an exercise in existentialism.    Unfortunately, the handful of insightful essays/articles do not offset the rest of the book. Most of the book reads like a fanzine (a fan-produced, fan-edited, usually low-quality collection of articles that are insightful and witty to only the most diehard fans). Chief among these were the silly \\"The Rise and Fall (and Rise) of Firefly,\\" and the dreadfully un-funny and irrelevent \\"Firefly vs. The Tick.\\" Many of the essays are guilty of simply overanalyzing the show to death. Yes, you can pick at the parts fo Firefly (the western part, the sci-fi part...) and find lots of flaws--but what none of the essays seem to point out is that it's the sum of the parts that makes this show such a wonderful thing.    Perhaps the worst of the bunch is \\"I Want Your Sex...\\" a seemingly endless man-hating rant by an irate Buffy fan that berates Joss Whedon for not taking the initiative to make the Firefly universe a matriarchal society where women wield all of the power and men are simply window dressing. The characters of Firefly--ALL of them--are strong characters, stronger than those on most shows on television today. To say that the women of this show were marginalized and weak is just plain silly. Everyone who's ever watched the show KNOWS Zoe could kick everyone's [back] on that ship and take command. The fact that she choses NOT to do so (as my wife points out) shows STRENGTH not weakness. The fact that she is devoted to and dotes on her husband is not a weakness (as the writer of the essay would have you believe) but a personal choice. The fact River is not interested in relationships with men on the ship (or off the ship) doesn't maker her character sexless--it doesn't make her ANYTHING. It just is. The girl has other priorities. She's a fugitive, after all...    I'll stop ranting now.    Anyway, if you're looking to supplement your Serenity movie experience, buy the Firefly DVDs, the novel, and the making-of book. (Skip the first step if you already own the DVDs.) As for this book--the few bright spots are hardly worth the price of admission.	2005-10-12

It attempts to develop evidence to support the author's conclusion that the operations of al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden are really extensions of U.S. geo-political strategy to dominate the Central Asian Republics and to control the petroleum reserves of the Near East. Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed has accumulated a good deal data in support of his arguments, but has done so very selectively ignoring  large amounts of equally relevant data that does not support his conclusions. Further, Ahmed  has a rather idiosyncratic interpretation of the data he has selected which not all readers would agree with. He also attributes a higher level of focus and competence to the American Government than I think the evidence will support. In short this book presents a well written, well documented, but highly implausible  conspiracy theory. An objective review of all the data relevant to al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden will demonstrate, I think, that the global Islamic terrorist movement is not the witting or unwitting tool of U.S. Global Strategy.<br /><br />Yet I gave the book four stars. The U.S. Government has absolutely failed to regain the credibility it lost as the result of the Vietnam War and its aftermath so it is important that books like this continue to be written to call into question the motives and intentions of its officials. An open mind is the best path to clear thinking.	2005-10-12

The stories themselves, moreover, are indeed more literary than perhaps more authentic collections, such as Kevin Danaher's, and are therefore a little more interesting to read.  I plan to use this text in a course on Irish literature both because the tales are a good introduction to Irish folklore and because the tales demonstrate how the early-twentieth-century Irish Renaissance adopted, adapted, and remolded the Irish Gaelic tradition.	2005-10-12

This is a great book for anyone who hasn't read the old interviews contained within this volume. However, I have read these interviews over the years and so there are no insights for anyone else who read them in The Comics Journal over the years. The art contained within this volume, on the other hand, is quite wonderful and a good deal of it is different, an update from the original interviews. Make no mistake, this book is a great art  collection with insightful, if older interviews to round it out. The large format is guite nice for showcasing the art as well.  <br />If you've somehow missed the interviews this is an opportunity to get into the heads of some stellar talents in the illustration and comic art field. With a line up a talent featuring the works and words of Frank Frazetta, Russ Manning, Burne Hogarth, Mark Schultz and Russ Heath, it's hard to imagine how the editors at TCJ could mess this up and, of course, they didn't. <br />My big beef is the lack of better Manning and Heath art.

I read this book when it was first released in the late 1970's. It was recommended to me by my father, an avid reader and bibliophile. I was only 18 years old, but this wonderous novel had the same impact as CATCH 22 or RAGTIME did for me. I knew this book would be with me my whole life, and that I would return to it time and again. I have since read it four times, and I just finished it again late this evening. Instead of sleeping I decided to write some slender memories: seeing John Kennedy Toole's mother on THE TOM SNYDER SHOW in the early 1980's had a profound impact on me. When she told of her son's struggles and difficulties getting this work published, prior to taking his own life at a criminally young age, I realized that it is one of life's great mysteries how so many publishers passed on this book. It was only at the urging of Walker Percy that the LSU press first published this masterpiece.  Being blind to genius is a universal privilege, after all! <br /> <br />On my fifth complete reading I still laughed as Ignatius rolls his hot dog cart down the street with the sign \\"12 Inches of Paradise\\" handwritten on the side. And I was once again felt melancholic when I finished this book, because I will never be able to read another novel by this misunderstood literary genius.

It is clearly organized in 6 chapters, plus an introduction and a conclusion, and you can find useful information about most of the narratives that are part of the cannon of Spanish American fiction.  In that sense, it is not a revolutionary or innovative work, and owes a lot to the previous research by scholars such as John Brushwood, although Lindstrom incorporates recent scholarship as well in her work.  That's the only reason I do not give it 5 stars.  Note also that the book does not include the literature of Brazil or other non Spanish-speaking countries of the continent (it is not Latin American narrative, only Spanish American). <br />Recommended for libraries and students interested in Spanish American literature and culture.	2005-10-12

Easy read and opened, honest opinions all stated in points (quatrains of Nostradamus) where the author was unable to explain (translate).<br /><br />The book starts off pointing to the life of Nostradamus who was a decendant of Jewish family. He, like everyone in a religious union during the 1500 period in Europe, had to escape the persecution of being what he later decided to devout to the Lord. This book should be followed up with a second volume to fill in those quatrains unexplained by the author as I would think that she's re-reading her translations and all the unexplained quatrains which now today she may have figured out.<br /><br />This is a fantastic read and very intriguing for sure. I like the mystical aurora it presents. From time to time, I would pick it up and find translations that has just come true or find some that are partially prophesized.<br /><br />However, the Bible is the source of all prophecies. And that really is coming to light today.	2005-10-12

I recently took courses in 3DMax, Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects.  Ok, so now what?  This is where Mike's books come in. His books are not step by step technical instructions on how to create computer graphics art  but more about stimulating the artistic side of your brain and imagination as to the kinds of art that can be created using computer graphics tools. This book is not about CG technology, it's about CG art. If your background is purely technical I would recommend this book in conjunction with a couple of art courses. Great computer art is not created by CG technicians  but by CG artist. Mike gives you guidelines as to what you can do as a skilled CG artist. He does not show you in detail how to create the art shown in the book. I guess he assumes that if you know the CG tool well enough then you should be able to figure out the details. Again this is a book about computer art, it is not about technology.	2005-10-12

It was written by a senior officer who spent his journeyman years under Soviet premiers from Brezhnev to Gorbachev, but filled prominent positions in the senior defense councils of de-imperialized Russia in the 1990s.  It reflects both his intimate knowledge of accepted strategic-military theory in the old Soviet Union, and his ability to step outside that tradition for a critical look. <br /> <br />Kokoshin tells his intended story well, and in that simple sense conveys a useful message.  But a Western reader learns much more from a contextual analysis of his information.  Possibly the most poignant passage is found on pp 186-7 of the 1999 MIT Press paperback edition, where Kokoshin paints a picture of Soviet military theorists in the 1980s focusing all their energies on the lessons of WWII and the Battle of Kursk. <br /> <br />The powerful counterpoint of that image with the reality of American theoretical efforts at the same time is not what Kokoshin intends to evoke -- but that in itself is another telling fact.  The overall impression one compiles from reading this book is that while the United States was, decade after decade, improving its ability to \\"project power\\" globally and wage expeditionary warfare on a large scale (e.g., Desert Storm), the Soviet Union was busy fitting all the new technology, new weapons, and new logistic potential into the land warfare mold of WWII. <br /> <br />The book reinforces this impression from start to finish.  Acclaimed Soviet theorist Mikhail Tukhachevsky wrote what essentially became the Warsaw Pact strategy vs NATO in an issue of the Journal of Military History in 1934, under the perennial Soviet belief that the capitalist powers would seek to invade Russia in force -- and that strategy changed only in its employment of weapons and tactics over the next 50 years.  Kokoshin confirms the conclusion of many Western analysts thatin the 1960s-70s the Soviet military saw nuclear weapons as adjuncts to a campaign strategy, rather than as agents for transforming war into a cosmic Gotterdammerung.  It was in the 1980s that Soviet thinking began to reject nuclear use as unrealistic, in the way American thinking had begun to more than a decade earlier. <br /> <br />Kokoshin presents his history without once indicating that the Soviets found the concept of mutual assured destruction philosophically compelling, and I find no reason to disbelieve him.  It is just possible that American and Soviet Russian modes of strategic thinking were out of sync through much of the Cold War.  Kokoshin provides another argument for this assessment in conveying the Soviet perception of the USSR's overall strategic situation, throughout its life:  i.e., surrounded, by wealthy maritime powers. <br /> <br />Contrast this with the governing perception of most Western thinkers, that the key geopolitical factor in the global situation was Soviet landpower versus Europe.  Halford Mackinder and Nicholas Spykman did their work well in this regard, giving us the World Island/Heartland vs Rimland construct, and reflecting the Western European/American Rimland as peripheral and importunate against a great land power (Soviet Russia) with a continent at its back. <br /> <br />Few in the West saw the situation as the Soviets did, even while the West gradually accumulated both the technology and doctrine to \\"project\\" land power over the sea in a way the continental Soviet Union could not.  Kokoshin's history doesn't lead me to think the Soviets saw this discrepancy clearly either; they just represented one side of it.  Perhaps the West's rapidly improving ability to project power through expeditionary warfare increased the Soviet sense of surroundedness, but apparently it did not persuade the Soviets to rethink their own core military strategy, which remained boresighted on armor and deep battle in central Europe. <br /> <br />An additional lesson from Kokoshin's book is the difference in the evolution of military-strategic thought when it is not subject to public political criticism, as opposed to when it is.  Western military theorists are never insulated from political trends and second-guessing, as Soviet thinkers once were.  Possibly a little more outside review might have provoked greater foresight and less geopolitical atrophy in Soviet strategic thought.  One must admit, however, that vigorous dispute and political oversight in the West, while they drove a forward-leaning development of global expeditionary capability, didn't perform very well at pinpointing or exploiting the self-perception of the Soviet opponent.  All systems have their limitations.	2005-10-12

Lawson does not seem very favorably disposed to those she describes.  She describes some who behave rather badly (killing their children in some cases). <br /> There's always been a problem with psychiatric diagnoses that we cannot confirm by blood tests or X-rays. The \\"borderline personality\\" diagnosis is especially fuzzy. It fits anyone who is selfish and over-emotional.  Lawson stretches the diagnosis to include a number of well-known personalities she has never met, and blurs the edges even more. She adds a typology of her own; the waif, the queen, the witch and the hermit. These are just off the top of her head and are not validated by any kind of statistics or experimental work.  When she does mention anything about brain chemistry or anatomy or about medication it's in passing, and some of it is wrong.  <br /> The ways of managing such mothers she suggests are more in the nature of advice for their children (often quite good advice) than proven methods of therapy. <br /> The quality of the writing is excellent. The author knows how to tell a story and keep the pages turning. I'm sure many will read it and recognize situations or people they have encountered, as we do when we read a good novel. This is closer to imaginative literature than to science, but it's very good imaginative literature. <br />	2005-10-12

In a novel where dialogue is rich and continuous one can imagine how fortunate this is.<br />Someone should also have told the publisher that the cover picture, though beautiful in itself, has nothing to do with the Vth century b.C. Greece Ms Renault takes so much pain to depict.<br /><br />This author has a beautiful sense of storytelling: the plot itself is nothing new to a contemporary reader, the love and friendship of two young men in a Greece illuminated by Sokrates' thinking and devastated by a cruel war, but she tells it, simply and compellingly, and she never fails to keep her reader's interest.<br /><br />Before discussing the book's flaws I wish to stress how this novel stands out among ordinary fiction. This told, one has to point out that the philosophing is often clumsy; the competitions rhetorical and the overall style not always as polished as in some paragraphs Ms Renault ha clearly written with more care.<br /><br />To me there is another flaw but I admit it would be unjust to give it undue weight, this book belonging to a woman probably born at the beginning of the century.<br />She writes with ease of the homosexual liaisons typical of ancient Greece, making no fuss about them and giving her attention to the feelings involved, but she betrays her embarassment when dealing with her two main heroes: she makes two disciples of Sokrates' ideas about love of them, thus avoiding too close physical intimacy between the two; later, when they finally surrender to their passion, the fact is hardly mentioned and NEVER quoted again.	2005-10-12

I can only think of one previous novel which so deftly explored the inner demons of someone losing their memory, and that was Peter Dickinson's thriller ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, in which the detective hero found himself in an old age home and, although barely able to keep it together, made one more triumphant leap into deduction (and action) to keep one last crime at bay.<br /><br />Nick, the hero of OBLIVION, isn't a very nice guy, and only through losing something (his memories of a \\"lost weekend\\" during which he began investigating a case of a runaway girl) does he come to his senses morally speaking.  His difficult relationship with his estranged son, Dmitri, and his nagging love for a former wife who walked out on him when she found him cheating with a partner--these relationships change as Nick finds it within himself to change and to try imagining how others may feel for once.  This brings up all sorts of satisfying speculations on what is the nature of personality?  Is it something consistent, essentialist, that doesn't change, or is it entirely a mode of chemical behavior?<br /><br />One little side note, I loved the TV movie of the week that was made out of Nick's work on the Reasoner case.  Abrahams has the casting down pat--Armand Assante as himself, Kim Delaney (herself the troubled good girl for whom America still cherishes a soft spot) and Dennis Franz, Delaney's co-star on NYPD Blue, as the mad serial killer Gerald Reasoner.  I'd watch it, and hate myself in the morning!  But reading OBLIVION you just crawl out on some primitive branch of pleasure like an ocelot, and soak in the sun.<br /><br />Kudos also to the book designer, who uses numbers and capital letters with parts of them melted off, to parallel Nick's fading memories.	2005-10-12

Tom Wright gives us a highly readable and quite enjoyable introduction to the gospel of Mark, informed by both his deep New Testament scholarship and his wide pastoral experience and perspective.  This is Mark, truly for everyone. While there won't be much here that is new for those well-acquainted with current NT research, Wright plainly illuminates Mark's themes and places them properly in the context of the times.  Wright's own translations of the original text are clear and contemporary to the right degree.  For his intended audience - the general educated reader - Wright is on target.  This would be a good pick for a teen or adult NT study group.  Read it, and your faith will be even better secured on a firm foundation of understanding.  Wright knows how to go after the very core, the kernel, of faith. <br /> <br />Reading it, it is easy to hear Tom Wright's baritone voice in his adept prose; he is so effortless to read that it is easy to overlook how good a writer he in fact is.  The medium is properly transparent and subordinate to the message. <br /> <br />This series reminds me of the one authored years ago by William Barclay; each author has his own strengths and appeal and both could be read with profit by the Christian wishing to better understand the New Testament.  If I had to recommend just one, it would be Wright, without question.  But that would be to ignore the often top-notch pastoral sermon aspects - albeit old-fashioned- of Barclay's writings.	2005-10-12

I say musical wallpaper because it smacked of country, of the recently immigrated.  I prefered instead R&B.  Later, I preferred anything (ragas, jazz, American folk, soul, tropical) other than the music that Elijah Wald writes about.  After visiting Mexico several times as an adult and hearing rancheras and pop and cumbia, the feeling for the music of Mexico began to grow.  After reading Mr. Wald's book I realized that I had ignored a genre of music that had, in fact, been a part of my life from the beginning. Read this book and then buy the music.  If you are learning Spanish as a second language, you can generally find the lyrics on-line.  There is no better way (short of taking a Mexican lover) to learn and love this beautiful language.  The book is well-written, well-reasearched, and will open your musical mind.	2005-10-12

But is this poet well understood, and are her birthdays and other important dates even recognized other than by those already devoted to her? One editorial reviewer for Amazon of the Cambridge Companion makes a key mistake-stating that she is one of our most important \\"19th Century poets.\\"  No--Dickinson is one of the two most important American poets in all our literature-of whatever century, and most likely including this new one- the other candidate for top honors being Walt Whitman. Arguably, Dickinson is the more important of the two given the resonance in our later poetry with the depth of her interior, private vision. Whitman aspired to be America's great public bard-a project Robert Pinsky and others have pointed out that did not succeed (see my Amazon review of Pinsky's Democracy, Culture and the Voice of Poetry). But Dickinson's intense private vision is more responsible than Whitman's public one for generating followers and inspiring others. Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane are two examples. With rare exceptions, American poetry has developed more along the lines suggested by her more private vision and voice than it has to the broad, public sweep of Whitman's long-windedness.    Everyone more or less knows who Dickinson is, and most educated persons have probably read at least one of her poems. But, do we grasp what a deep treasure trove Dickinson has left us? Do we get beyond the superficial portrait most have of her? And most importantly, how do we access the wealth of creativity and insight that lies beyond the few dozen or so most popular Dickinson poems most of us are familiar with?    Wendy Martin's Cambridge Companion to Emily Dickinson is a great place to start broadening our view of her. The war over Dickinson's manuscripts (today part still belong to Harvard and part to Amherst College) and for defining her as a person is something that happened shortly after she died and was caused by a schism of sorts in her family when her brother, Austin Dickinson, took a lover, Mabel Loomis Todd, outside of his marriage to Emily's beloved friend, companion and lifelong correspondent, Susan Dickinson. This is a really racy story!   It is ably narrated in Betsy Erkkila's essay \\"The Emily Dickinson Wars.\\"    Christopher Benfey's essay \\"Emily Dickinson and the American South,\\" is also remarkable. How do you explain the fact that Dickinson wrote throughout the Civil War, Emancipation, etc. and has almost nothing to say about these huge events? While not a Southern sympathizer, there is much in her work that accords with the agrarian, aristocratic elements in American life that was also represented in the South and its literature, and she fit the sensibility of those who yearned for a pre-Industrial America in the 20th Century quite well-although it doesn't really fully define her to see it in this way.    Wendy Martin's own essay on Dickinson's poetic strategies is a strong overview of how some of the larger elements in Dickinson's life worked themselves out in her verse, including her deeply meaningful relationship with her sister-in-law.  Martin is very strong on her analysis of the poetic use of words like \\"sun\\" which appears so often in the poems, and she sees Dickinson as one who revels with her volcanic creativity in night and darkness. It's a luxurious image and picture of her.    I have to confess that, though our last names are the same, I am no relation to Emily Dickinson. Starting when I was a very young child, my mother (who grew up not far from Amherst in a similar setting) read her to me frequently, and I was somewhat confused about the name.  For quite some time I thought when my mother said we were \\"not related\\" that we really were related. I felt the poems were something that had been written to us, like letters from a relative, which were also sometimes read aloud to the family. I was disappointed to learn that \\"no relation\\" actually meant we weren't related-and somehow before figuring it out got some of the deeper messages even as a very young child -it was as though they had been meant especially for me and sent from a kindred soul.       One suggestion for how to celebrate Emily Dickinson's birthday each December 10th is to read this book and others like it-and to re-encounter Dickinson's poems over and over.  They richly repay our efforts to understand and enjoy them.	2005-10-12

Este libro es una coleccin de ensayos que tiene su origen en un coloquio sobre literatura cubana celebrado en la Universidad de Yale en 2002 para conmemorar el primer siglo de literatura de la Repblica de Cuba.  Muchos de los ensayos corresponden a crticos influyentes dentro de las letras cubanas y cubanoamericanas (Gonzlez Echevarra o Prez Firmat, por ejemplo), aunque se echan de menos a los crticos de la isla (como Fernndez Retamar).  Como siempre ocurre con Cuba, esto se puede deber a problemas de visado o de rencillas ideolgicas.  Los ensayos son de valor desigual, pero algunos son muy interesantes: un posible \\"canon\\" cubano, la literatura del periodo especial, marcada por el dlar, ensayos sobre Carpentier y Cabrera Infante, etc... <br />Recomendable para bibliotecas, estudiantes y profesores de literatura cubana o caribea, y en general, a los amantes de las letras hispanas.	2005-10-12

It is hard to match the original, as this pedestrian attempt amply illustrates. Homer tells the story with poetry, drama, passion, and tenderness. Mike Chapman's version, on the other hand, is Christianized drivel which is bland, misleading, and often inaccurate.<br /><br />Mr. Chapman writes satisfactorily and may even love his subject, but he does not respect it. He has removed the vibrancy of Homer's epic by shifting its emphasis. Gone is the mythology of Achilles' lineage: his mother was the nymph, Thetis, daughter of the sea god Nereus. Mr. Chapman, inexplicably, makes Poseidon her father and Thetis a deluded woman who just thinks she is divine.  Gone is the decisive part the gods play in the story, altering it irrevocably.  Their interaction with and influence on the mortals, as well as the demigod Achilles, are integral to Homer's epic poem.  The costly 10-year war between the Greeks and Trojans was both precipitated and prolonged by the bickering gods.<br /><br />If the author's goal was to 'modernize' Homer by inventing 'rational' alternatives to the mythological and supernatural aspects of Homer's epic, he has succeeded only in removing its mystery and power.  Chiron, the wise centaur (half-man half-horse) who tutored Achilles in fighting, music, and the healing arts is merely a remarkable horseman.  No mention is made of Hephaestus, the smith god who forged Achilles' wondrous armor -  a plot point on which rests the fates of Patroclus, Achilles, Hector, and the tide of the war itself. Gone is the quiet magic of King Priam's touching nocturnal pilgrimage, aided by the god Hermes, to plead for Hector's body from angry, inconsolable, noble Achilles.<br /><br />Gone as well is any suggestion that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers. Their sexual relationship is widely recognized, as homosexuality between aristocratic Greek men and boys was a codified part of the society in general and the military in particular.  Here they are good buddies. By choosing to ignore their love, Mr. Chapman has eliminated the reason for Achilles' terrible grief and rage. Patroclus' ghost bade his beloved companion, \\"Just as we grew up together in our youth, so let our bones rest side by side and our ashes be mingled in the same urn.\\"  They were buried side by side and, centuries later, their graves were honored by two other great lovers of the ancient world, Alexander the Great and Hephaistion.<br /><br />I suspect Mr. Chapman fig-leafed Achilles' potent story to make it more `palatable' to modern (i.e., Christian) tastes and sensibilities. What he has wrought is an unimaginative war story, without magic or myth, which deeply diminishes Homer and his brilliant subject.ly recognized, as homosexuality between aristocratic Greek men and boys was a codified part of the society in general and the military in particular.

I have been a fan of Mr. Stirling's writing since a friend gave me a copy of 'Island in the Sea of Time'.  He continues to make me a happy reader with his new series begun in 'Dies the Fire' and continued here in 'The Protector's War'.<br /><br />  In contrast to some of the other reviewers' I really really like his inclusion of the Wiccan society and ritual in the storyline.  I am not a Wiccan myself, as a matter of fact I'm agnostic if anything, but I found his presentation of paganism to be very open-minded and interesting.  The fact that one almost never hears of this religion outside of a book written by one of it's adherants makes it a nice change from the usual Judeo-Christian centered stories.  Contrast is a good thing in my opinion.<br /><br />  Otherwise he continues to please with his speculation of where things would go and what people would do.  I would perhaps disagree with some of his conclusions but that's kinda what speculation is all about.  It makes your imagination run around inside your head and that's why I love these kinds of books written by Steve Stirling, Harry Turtledove and Eric Flint.	2005-10-12

Reading these themes, presented in a new way, is very valuable and I felt the truth of this book sinking in while reading it.  I was so absorbed I literally read through it in a weekend.<br /><br />Going to the source (ACIM) also is recommended but ACIM can take months to read and takes a serious commitment.  \\"Everyday Miracles\\" is certainly a good option to familiarize yourself quickly with the concepts of metaphysical living through forgiveness, love and expecting miracles.<br /><br />For some reason several typos got through the early editions but I am sure later editions have corrected the issue BUT even if there are some typos, do not let these silly surface errors stand in the way.

I've read all of Robin Maxwell's books (except for [[ASIN:0060091436 The Wild Irish: A Novel of Elizabeth I and the Pirate O'Malley]]) and I'm happy to say that her writing style, which can sometimes be a bit sticky, has improved much in this book. The story is much more readable then in her past books, and the plot is fantastic. Her characters (all real historical figures) have clear motivations for what they do in this book.      But anyway, to the plot. This is a novel about the tower princes, Edward IV's two sons who disappeared after their uncle Richard III steals the crown. Although popular history has Richard murdering his two nephews, Maxwell has a different and very credible theory. The story is told as a narrative to young Henry VIII, by his mother Queen Elizabeth and his godmother Nell Caxton, daughter of the first man to print books in English.    The amount of freedom that Nell and Bessie have may seem odd to some, but its in accord with their status (which was privelaged) and education backround. England at the time before Edward IV's death was fairly peaceful, and this book is really about the change from that peace into the harsh danger of war time and roayl takeovers.     Readable and entertaining, this book is perfect for the Tudor maniac or just plain historical fiction fans out there.	2005-10-12

President Abraham Lincoln, his wife Mary and family would journey to the Soldiers Retirement Home about 4 miles from the White House. Son Robert would visit on his trips home from Harvard. Youngest Lincoln son Tad enjoyed the Soldiers' Home where he had a menagerie of pets; got to know the guard troops from Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio stationed there. Wife Mary was often vacationing in New England or shopping in New York.<br /><br />  In this atmosphere Lincoln enjoyed the camaraderie of soldiers; received visitors and enjoyed the company of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton living in a nearby cottage.<br /><br />  It was in this location that the President agonized over his decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation; decided to fire<br /><br />George B. McClellan and help plan the 1864 presidential campaign.<br /><br />  Every day Lincoln would ride a horse to the White House surrounded by mounted cavalryman. His wife Mary fell from her carriage in July, 1863 while traveling to the home. She was seriously injured .<br /><br />  Pinsker tells us of plots against Lincoln's life. He may have even been fired upon by an unknown assassin according to a soldier who reported this incident in his postwar memoirs.<br /><br />  Matthew Pinsker has written an outstanding book adding to our knowledge of the heretofore little known Lincoln residence at the Soldiers Home. The Home is now a National Landmark and is being renovated and opened for the public. One can imagine how awed poet Walt Whitman was as he saw Lincoln on his daily ride from the White House to the Soldiers Home.<br /><br />  Pinsker draws on a vast array of first person accounts, letters,memoirs and can be complimented on adding to our knowledge of the Lincoln presidency.<br /><br />  The book is well illustated with maps and is an outstanding addition to anyone interested in the Civil War and the Lincoln presidency.

He did not look away from ugly truths in his life or art. (Read the autobiography and understand the significance of this approach!)<br /><br />I recommend this book as the touchstone for a deeper appreciation of the art of Kurosawa, for an understanding of his complex personality, and for the human warmth that comes across in his reminiscences. By the end of the book, you will want more, of course. It will seem to end abruptly and too soon. You will have many questions that you will wish to have answered.

Being a sincere student of Advaita Vedanta (Non-duality) for many years and inspired by the works of Gangaji, Ramana Maharshi, Satyam Nadeen and others, I find David Hawkins's book a major contribution to this body of spiritual Truth and Knowledge. Speaking from the unique perspective of a medical scientist and Self Realized Soul, Hawkins is able to language his experience in a uniquely linear and nonlinear fashion that speaks eloquently to the Western mind. Being a psychiatrist, he can couch his experience and explain the Self Realization process in both a psychological and spiritual context that penetrates the right brain as well as the left. The Truth quotient, based on his callibration system, scores very high and I found simply reading this book raised my consciousness and revealed inner Truth and Revelation beyond the printed word. Truly, this book is blessed as any great spiritual volume, and thus it has the ability to dramatically shift awareness from the self to the Self. This is profound! I can not rate this book high enough! It is a priceless Jewel.	2005-10-12

Upon reading it, I only felt filled with much more anxiety about the whole process in part because of its ommissions.  While there are whole chapters on the emotional aspects of the deployment, most of the information is general and useless.  Some of it appears to just have been cut and pasted from other books that have no relation to deployment or military life.   Giving only one spouse's perspective is another weakness.  The author only experienced Marine deployments and treated 1 year overseas deployments as outside the norm.  For Army families, they are common and there is very little information about what to do when a spouse is gone for more than six months.  It, like most deployment counseling, offers no help to the families who are not integrated in to a unit - and therefore have no FRG which \\"Surviving Deployment\\" laziliy suggests turning to for all questions left unanswered.	2005-10-12

Reacher is a retired Army MP Major who left the service because the downsized military after the fall of the Soviet Union left him with too small a field of play.  He spends his days now, traveling about, seeing the things he missed as a career soldier.  He gets off a Greyhound bus in the middle of Georgia to visit the birthplace of a blues musician his brother once recommended to him.  What he encounters is an almost immediate arrest for the gruesome murder of an unidentified victim.  Reacher is able to prove he wasn't even in the state at the time of the killing, and offers a tip to the sheriff about how to identify the body.  His tip was successful, but devastating to Reacher, as he learns that the body is that of his brother, a US Treasury agent on assignment.  Reacher makes finding the killers his own responsibility and leads the reader through a tale of local corruption, brutal adversaries and close calls for himself and the beautiful deputy who befriends him.  A great adventure read that mixes the technical detail of a Clancy novel with the almost superhuman capability of a James Bond type hero.	2005-10-12

This book has very interesting pacing.  The first chapter explodes with a stoning of a prostitute and introduces the jailer and one of the people who did the stoning.  The book then calms down, introduces a few more characters, and then builds and builds until the climax.<br /><br />This reminded me a lot more of a short story than it did of a novel, even though it's 200 pages long.  The story is very tight, and just like when I've read a really good short story, I felt like I didn't get all of the intricacies in the story.<br /><br />This book is translated from French, and I think that the translator used much bigger words than were really needed, but it surprisingly didn't take away too much from the book.  Besides the vocabulary, the translation was very good.<br /><br />I also think this is an interesting story regardless of the setting.  I don't know much about politics or current events, but was still very intrigued by the whole story.<br /><br />This story is a tragedy.  I love tragedies, and that's what fascinated me most about this book.	2005-10-12

He then attempts to magically weave them together into a kind of Unified Theory of group behavior. His assertions are suspect, not based on fact. ALso, many times his conclusions do not logically follow from his premises.  They may be AN answer, but they are certainly not the ONLY answer. <br /> <br />In the end, the author sees patterns where he wishes them to be.

However, the focus of the book seems to be to convince the reader of the superiority of Christianity.  Since I am already a Christian, I didn't need that.

Raymond Brown and Joseph Fitzmyer, among others, put together the premier modern Catholic biblical commentary in the late 1960s in \\"The Jerome Biblical Commentary.\\"  A little over 20 years later, they offer this updated version.  The preparation, as noted in the Foreward, involved inter-denominational studies and the volume (it is hoped) will play a part in ecumenical efforts.  This is not suprising given the late Fr. Brown's association with Union Theological Seminary and Fr. Fitzmyer's experise in Aramaic and Judaic studies.<br /><br />The commentary itself is accessible to the intelligent, theologically informed layperson.  It is of special value for clergy or academics.  My priest uses it for homiletic background research.  The commentary reflects a modern critical approach to which many traditionalists may disagree.  I find it to be sensible and conform to my understanding of the modern scientific textual approach.  And while concise, this oversized book still comes in at almost 1500 pages.  I use this commentary along with NAB Study Bible footnotes and various Anchor Bible commentaries for my personal study and Catholic work.  I contrast it with my NIV Study Bible notes and a few other commentaries for my interfaith communications.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me are the topical articles written by experts in their fields.  The articles take up the issues of Inspiration (what it is, how it has been understood, its authority and source, its history), Canonicity (an examination of the history of what is considered \\"scripture\\"), Apocrpypha and other Jewish Literature, Texts and Versions (Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic targums, etc.), Modern Old Test. Criticism, Modern New Test. Criticism, Hermeneutics and so on.  Included also are articles on the History of Israel, Pauline Theology, Johannine Theology and a fascinating article on Jesus by John Meier (author of \\"A Marginal Jew\\" and other works on the historical Jesus).	2005-10-12

A tale introducing two radically different and contrary main characters, Nathaniel the apprentice and Bartimeus the powerful and clever djinni. The book focuses on their strained relaltionship and differs from the Harry Potter books in its portrayal of magic as the conjuring and subsequent binding of mischievous spirits, rather than spellslinging and waving of wands. \\"Cthuluesque\\" could be a good description of the Bartimeus-magic, when the mythology-part is slightly subratracted from the lot.

Before writing this review, I spent some time looking over many of the other reviews on here.  The spread is interesting, and I think it comes from a misunderstanding of the very limited scope of this book.<br /><br />First off, if you're looking for a book to explain the innate differences (if there are any?) between men and women, this is definitely not it.  Further, if you're looking for a book that dives deep into communication theory and has profound statements regarding the nature of good communication, this is equally lacking.  The title betrays the purpose.  This book is a badly written collection of common sense ideas and tactics to use when communicating in a relationship.<br /><br />Why 4 stars?  Because common sense is not as common as people think.  I am amazed at the 1-star ratings by \\"intellectuals\\" who charge that this book stands on very shaky philosophic ground, and that it does not live up to the high caliber of true scientific studies into communication fundamentals and/or gender differences.  Get a grip!  That's not the purpose of the book!<br /><br />This book is equivalent to an \\"Idiot's Guide to Listening, Respect, and Communication, with Easy-to-Remember Examples.\\"  Intellectuals charging that the common person should read XYZ's scientific study about the fundamentals is missing the basic point -- I don't want to know the fundamentals of communication (at the moment), I just want to know why my last girlfriend got offended when I offered solutions when she was complaining about work.  Sounds simple?  Not for all of us.<br /><br />I have a degree in rocket engineering and I am very confident that I could tear a book about \\"Physics for the common person\\" to ribbons for making vast over-generalizations and ignoring (what I consider to be) key details in the trade.  I could easily humble half the readers of this review if we were talking about rocket dynamics.  But would I criticize a beginner's physics book if it generates interest in my favorite subject? Of course not! You can't mock a beginner's book for not addressing the advanced issues.<br /><br />Further, it is hard to argue with the couples who say their marriage has been saved by this book.  All idealism and charges of misogynistic text aside - if it works, it works.  Period.<br /><br />I find it kind of humorous that those most offended by the generalizations made in this book are the ones most quickly to generalize.  You must remember: Not all stereotypes are false, or even bad.  When I go to China and sit down at a restaurant, I'm going to ask for chopsticks, and not forks.  Why?  Because I stereotype all people in China as eating with chopsticks.  Is this bad, or just efficient?<br /><br />Many men and women fall into the stereotypes as described in this book.  Whether or not you agree with those stereotypes as being \\"right\\" or \\"acceptable\\" is really irrelevant to the point.  Further, the stereotypes are just a method of conveying the information.  Gray is just trying to document the two different most common reactions to stress, and labels them \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" according to stereotype.  He might as well have labeled them \\"North\\" and \\"South\\" for all I care -- the point is not the male/female generalizations, the point is understanding BOTH ways of dealing with stress (talking about it or receding into thought) and how to correctly handle it when you or your partner starts doing either.<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, let's get off the charges of women-hating.  The book is almost literally a mirror within itself, as every paragraph generalizing women has its counterpart generalizing men.  While you can charge that he mislabels both equally, those who look at this evenly stacked book and somehow derive a women-bashing lean are simply playing up their own insecurities, opinions, and political stances regarding the genders.  The book is an almost word-for-word split between the two (if you don't believe me, go back and look!).  If youcan only see the women-bashing side of things, while nonchalantly accepting all the male generalizations, then you are reading through your own mental filter, and should take a moment to consider that.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those of you who may not have the common sense that the elitist intellectuals profess, nor the ludicrous sensitivity to one side of an equally balanced portrayal of (admittedly overgeneralized) gender roles.back and look!).

From the adventures of the pigeon to this tale of Trixie's wayward friend we have enjoyed all of Mo Willems' books and this one is fun from the black and white photos to the expressive characters that fill each page.<br /><br />One of my fellow reviewers gave the book a toss because they felt it was offensive to dads.  I have to say that even the most attentive father can forget about the favorite toy when things get hectic (I once left our \\"Knuffle Bunny\\" at a pharmacy).<br /><br />This book is so popular at my daughter's school that they actually had to ban it because the kids were starting to speak in Trixie's baby talk and it was disruptive in the classroom!<br /><br />Mo Willems has an excellent sense of humor and this book is simply a lot of fun.  Pick it up and it is bound to be a favorite in your collection!	2005-10-12

I've reviewed Lindsey Davis' FALCO mysteries before, and always rated them highly--something they deserved--for local color, human interest, scholarship, wit, and unusually good writing. <br /> <br />This one goes nowhere.  It's plodding, devoid of Falco's usual mental and physical exertions.  There's little if any character development except that Helena's brother Aelianus seems to be maturing and mellowing. Falco is acted upon, rather than being his usual competent and courageous self, someone who controls the denouement of the plot.  He makes an inordinate number of errors and bad judgments.  His actions turn to dust, and at the end nothing really has changed except that a sour widow has unnecessarily died. <br /> <br />The humor in all the others is missing here; instead there's a deep cynicism.  I'm sure Davis will hit her stride again, but this is the least important novel in the series.	2005-10-12

Wills does a wonderful job of context and fleshing out the personalities that Adams makes reference to.<br /><br />The two personalities, Jefferson and John Adams are quite fascinating. Henry Adams takes a position that Jeffersonians have for years misunderstood. His book is not so much a criticism of Jefferson (although some of Jefferson's notions, such as conquering Canada using the Virginia militia need criticism) as it is an analysis of the ironies of his administration.<br /><br />Anyone wishing to make sense of the USA now needs to understand the events of 1800-1808 and how they led to so many things we now take for granted.<br /><br />Wills' book is great reading and sheds some very valuable light on Henry Adams' personality and motivations. I loved this book.	2005-10-12

He discusses several classes of investments from index funds, cash equivalents, common stocks, fixed income, real estate, venture capital, market-neutral (hedge) funds, and several others.  You're not going to learn how to start your own fund, but you will get an idea of how to diversify an institutional portfolio among various investment classes.  You'll get some insight into the  politics involved in institutional investment (e.g. dealing w/ investment committes), investment manager tracking strategies (to properly evaluate your portfolio), and long-term investing (coming to terms w/ the fact that you're not going to beat the S&P every year).  Mr. Olson also speaks about pension payouts and a few things to consider from that perspective (like insurance, bulk payments, etc.).  Highly recommended for beginners or intermediates (as an overview) in this area.	2005-10-12

Many parents are afraid to take charge of their child and this book not only tells you how to do it, but why it is necessary.  Readers gain a deeper understanding of the needs of children at various ages and how to tailor your discipline to your child's intellectual and emotional abilities at his or her age.

Of all the photographic books I have read (most written for a more seasoned photographer), his simple approach was refreshing and helpful.  I believe that my recent work has improved due to his suggestions.  Thanks Bryan...keep writing!	2005-10-12

It came yesterday and I was up late last night finishing it. It is a mixture of history and legend about how a community of persecuted Jews in Turkey, more than a millennia ago packed up and moved to Kaifeng, China, the ancient capital in Henan province, because it had a reputation for being very tolerant. Amazingly, this community manages to survive in isolation up until the early 20th century even though they take on Chinese names, win converts, and eventually become ethnically Chinese. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there is no photo of this book. The illustrations are wonderful. It is a large thin book divided into 20 enhanced historical stories, fairly easy reading about 140 pages. My only complaints/suggestions are that there are no maps detailing the exodus from Turkey and their routes and stops along the Silk Roads. I lived in China for a year and am a bit more familiar with some of the things brought up in the story than the average American; however, I think Xu Xin and Betty Friend should have elaborated on some cultural and historical aspects, maybe provide some worldwide time tables. Also I and my Chinese friends would have enjoyed seeing the actual Chinese characters for many of the Chinese terms. To those unfamiliar, Chinese is a tonal language with a zillion homonyms. Story 14 was a bit confusing and the authors mix the pinyin, alphabetical system, with the older Wade-Giles system when naming some provinces.I would like to get in touch with Xu Xin but unfortunately, there is no website or e-mail provided.	2005-10-12

(This is harder than you would think)    <br /> <br />2)  Write down your desires, envision them, review them often, think about them often  <br /> <br />3)  Focus on the joy of having your heart's desire instead of the distress of not having it or jealousy if someone else has what you desire.   Be open and receptive to blessings.  EXPECT and believe that you will get what you desire.  Let the Universe handle the details.  In time,  the law of attraction will manifest the people and situations necessary for you to achieve/acquire the things that you desire.     The details of the manifestation process may not be exactly as envisioned, but the end result will be the same.  <br /> <br />4)  As you go about your life,  experiencing different things, your desires may change.   That's okay.  Revise your list and focus on your new desires. <br /> <br />  <br />I've only tried this process on worthy goals (ie.. more time to spend with my family,  spiritual growth,  more information on a particular subject).

In between, the reader is treated to well-composed and down right interesting images of the great bison herds of the midwest- (numbering in some 75 million),  and mounds of bones and skulls left over from the great slaughter at the end of the nineteent century. We learn of the Native American reliance upon the great bison...and that without the use of bison as a food resource, the West might never had been won. Dary's book is a must for History buffs and general readers who want a well-written and competantly documented saga...of the animal that really should be the actual symbol of America.	2005-10-12

So in view of the unblemished string of five-star reviews, cut me some slack if I tell you that \\"Falls the Shadow\\" is not up to the Lashner standards we've come to expect.<br /><br />This is by no means a bad novel.  Many of the strengths of earlier Lashner - the gritty Philadelphia neighborhoods, characters with more depth than the average cardboard cutout, storylines running from the unusual to the bizarre - are all here.  Told in the first person, the story unfolds as easily as if Carl were telling it to the reader over a brew at a Philly watering hole.  But this time around, the story feels tired, forced, lacking energy as Victor Carl grinds through familiar haunts feeling like one of \\"The Hollow Men\\" of the TS Elliot-referenced title.<br /><br />We find Carl and partner Beth Derringer taking on the case of Francois Dube, already serving time for the murder of his wife.  Dube, an insufferable French chef, maintains his innocence and, with financial backing from the equally obnoxious gold digger Velma Takahashi, convinces Carl, against all odds, to pursue a retrial.  True to Lashner's offbeat form, a meddling dentist, \\"Bob\\", plays a key role in the mystery of the Dube murder, as well as in a side plot involving a reluctant Carl's role in a pro bono case of child neglect.  Maybe it's the combination of annoying Frenchmen and of uncomfortable time in a dentist's chair. Or maybe it's the absence of the brutal color typically provided by Carl heavy Phil Skink, or the unnecessary tension between Carl and Beth.  Perhaps it's the rather contrived climax, or the confluence of too many players with too many stories trying too hard to deliver too many morals. But whatever the source, when all the drama has finally played out and the enigma that is Dr. Bob is unraveled,  \\"Falls the Shadow\\" simply misses the mark.  A better-than-average legal thriller, for sure, but one that ultimately fails to generate passion, falling short of Lashner's uncommon talents.finally played out and the enigma that is Dr. Bob is unraveled,  \\"Falls the Shadow\\" simply misses the mark.

I bought this book because I wanted to make delicious meals for my new hubby.  I didn't know how to cook alot of things, but I know my way around the kitchen.  I was very disappointed that out of 15 or so recipes, none had much taste.  Maybe I am biased because I am from Texas and we like our food spicy - or at least flavorful - but I thought everything was too bland.<br /><br />Instead I recommend \\"The Ultimate Southern Living Cookbook\\".  It does not claim to have nearly as many recipes, but the recipes it does have are flavorful and easy enough that novice chefs like myself can make a meal you'd be proud to serve to company or your beloved.<br /><br />Oh, in Bittman's credit, I think his recipes from his TV show are much better, probably because he is competing with world class chefs who inspire creativity and flavor.	2005-10-12

Patton's diaries from World War II.  At times, it is an illuminating and interesting look at Patton and his views, but probably because it was edited by his wife and others after Patton's death, many interesting parts of Patton's life are glossed over or ignored.  Anyone interested in Patton's war career or World War II would find this book interesting, and any current US Army officers should read this book for many of Patton's leadership lessons. <br /> <br />The book briefly describes parts of the North Africa and Sicily campaigns, and I found it very interesting to read about Patton's meetings with the Sultan of Morocco.  Most of the rest of the North African campaign was skipped, and after a few pages about the Sicily campaign, Patton is suddenly in northern Europe as the Third Army commander.  Most of his writings about the European campaign give daily updates on the condition and position of his subordinate divisions.  Fortunately, the book is replete with maps of most of the Third Army's areas of operations - something too many military history books forget. <br /> <br />For anyone hoping to find Patton's insights and feelings about the controversial incidents during his command, you won't find them in this book.  Most events are completely skipped over: the soldier slapping incidents are mentioned in two paragraphs on page 381 of 390 pages of text; there is no mention of Patton's difficult months after being passed over to lead the American D-Day effort and while serving as the \\"diversion\\" for a second invasion; there is no mention of Patton's comments and insults about the Soviet Russians as allies; and there is nothing about Patton and his tepid de-Nazification of his sector in Germany.  Also, when criticizing many of his subordinate commanders and discussing the relief of some commanders, this book omits the names of those being criticized and only refers to them by position; and the reader has to wonder if these criticisms were whitewashed by the editors after Patton's death. <br /> <br />Despite these shortcomings, this book still gives many insights into Patton's persona not found in most other works.  Too often, Patton is portrayed as a one-dimensional commander whose success relied on the discipline of his soldiers and his obsessiveness with the attack.  Anyone reading this book will quickly discover that Patton's brilliance as a commander was based on a well-developed command philosophy.  Patton understood that his role as an Army commander was to support his corps commanders and give them the moral support necessary when they grew weary.  Patton's flamboyant personality was part of this philosophy as well: for instance, he would always drive to the frontlines when visiting the frontlines but fly back to his headquarters, because he wanted his soldiers to always see him going forward and never see him leaving the front. <br /> <br />This book should be read by all current Army officers, because many of Patton's lessons are timeless.  He had a thorough understanding of the functions of his staff, and insisted that representatives from each staff section visit frontline units daily.  The book ends two many chapters on his personal views of the Army: a chapter called \\"Earning My Pay,\\" recounting various anecdotes throughout his Army career and the lessons he learned; and \\"Reflections and Suggestions,\\" with tactical advice for soldiers and commanders. <br /> <br />This book is mostly a detailed recounting of Patton's World War II European campaign.  For the casual reader wanting to learn more about the real Patton, I recommend looking elsewhere.  But WWII buffs and real George S. Patton fans will get a lot of insight from this book, and all current U.S. Army officers should read it for the timeless lessons that Patton teaches.	2005-10-12

The evidence presented is complex, involving literary sources, geology, and archaeology, but a critical portion of the author's argument is whether in Homeric times this western peninsula was separated from Cephalonia by a sea channel since closed up by earthquake-induced rockfalls.<br /><br />Although Bittlestone is \\"only\\" an enthusiastic amateur, his research has been reviewed and backed by his professional co-authors, one a professor of Greek and Latin and the other a geologist specializing in the Ionian island area.<br /><br />I find Bittlesone's analysis to be persuasive, but as yet -- and he recognizes this -- the evidence is not wholly conclusive.  This may come in the next several years with additional geological work to confirm the existence of the sea channel and with archaeological surveys to study various associated sites.	2005-10-12

There is so much division in the church already, of which is pointed out well in the book.  However, as a Christian who attends a Lutheran Church I KNOW our Pastors would NOT be sitting on the fence as described in this book.  Yes, it's just fiction, but such writing is typical from this \\"stripe\\" of Chirstianity of which I have once been a part.  If you are Lutheran, Catholic, Espicopal, Presp.you aren't really a Christian or your lukewarm at best.  I used to think that way and now it makes me sick.  I started reading this book thinking it was going to go in another direction and I was so dissapointed to see the typical sterotyping...it's almost not genuine to followers of Christ.<br /><br />The book also gets bogged down in far too many details of his past.

It is a deep, engaging read that is sure to raise a few goosebumps especially if you read it alone at night!  One of the best things I believe the book has to offer, however, is not the suspense, but rather a very indepth look at some extremely unique characters such as Hannibal Lector and Francis Dolorhyde.  They are so much more than simply \\"bad guys\\" or \\"freaks.\\"  Through Harris' excellent writing we have a chance to enter their minds and see what makes them tick.  What you find is troubling, disturbing, and perhaps if you aren't careful moving in some ways.  This is an excellent book and I hightly recommend it to anyone who likes a good scare or who is interested in unique throught provoking characters in story lines.  You'll find all you're looking for here and more.	2005-10-12

On January 10, 1929, the first installment of \\"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\\" was pubished in \\"Le Petit Vingti&egrave;m,\\" telling the story of a young reporter named Tintin and his pet foxhouse Snowy (Milou) as they journied through the Soviet Union.  The character of Tintin was modled on Paul Remi, Georges' brother, who was an officer in the Belgian army.  The result was one of the most universally beloved comic book characters in the history of the world, and this book is the fourth volume in a series that collects three of the Adventures of Tintin.<br /><br />Of course, you have been reading these in order, because if for some strange reason you start with Volume 4 then you begin with the second-half of an adventure that began in \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" (see Volume 3).  Although Herg&eacute; offers a bit of a recapitulation in the form of a conversation overhead in a bar at the beginning of \\"Red Rackham's Treasure,\\" you will really not be up to speed on this one. The main thing is that having collected all the clues regarding the titular treasure, Tintin and Captain Haddock are prepared to go forth and find it. However, almost as important as the search for the treasure is our introduction to the final pivotal member of the Tintin family, as Professor Cuthbert Calculus offers the service of his small shark-proof submarine for exploring the ocean floor. Tintin refuses the offer, but it turns out that Professor Calculus always hears somkething other than what somebody is really saying. Adding to the fun are the Thom(p)sons, who come alone with orders to protect Tintin.<br /><br />\\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\" is mostly a pure adventure story, with Tintin using the small submarine and a deep sea diving suit to look for the treasure of the Unicorn. But there is still some detective work left to be done to decipher the final cryptic clues left by Sir Francis Haddock concerning the treasure's location. I still like Herg&eacute;'s two-part adventure that sent Tintin to the Moon, but this two-parter is not far behind. This is the last of the Tintin stories Herg&eacute; wrote during World War II, and after this point we will definitely see his stories become much more allegorical in terms of post-War Europe. But this time around it is just Tintin, Snowy, and company out having fun beneath the deep blue sea.<br /><br />Tintin's next two-part adventure is included here as well, beginning with \\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\" and concluding in \\"Prisoners of the Sun.\\"  The story begins with Tintin on the train reading how the Sanders-Hardiman Ethnographic Expedition has returned a trip to Peru and Bolivia. The gentleman reading over Tintin's shoulder predicts trouble, drawing a parallel between what happened with the curse of King Tut-Ankh-Amen's tomb and these explorers violating the Inca's burial chambers. \\"What'd we say if the Egyptians or the Peruvians came over here and started digging up our kings?,\\" asks the gentleman; What'd we say then, eh?\\" The comment is important, not only because tragedy does strike the seven members of the expedition as they fall prey to the Crystal Balls of the book's title, but because one of the themes that Herg&eacute; develops in this particular epic is the respect Europeans should have for other cultures and ways of life.<br /><br />This point has been implict in many of Tintin's adventures, but it is a dominant element this time around. Assissted by his good friend Captain Haddock, Tintin becomes embroiled in the mystery, which takes a more personal turn when Professor Calculus is kidnapped. One interesting twist in this story is that Snowy actually ends up causing more trouble thanthe Thom(p)sons. There is a seriousness to what happens in \\"The Seven Crytal Balls\\" and \\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" that reflects a significant turning point in Herg&eacute;'s work, laying the ground work for his greatest tales, the two-part Moon story and \\"Tintin in Tibet.\\"<br /><br />\\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" concludes the epic Tintin adventure as the Sanders-Hardiman Ethnographic Expedition returns from a trip to Peru and Bolivia exploring Inca burial chambers when all seven members fell into comas induced by mysterious crystal balls. Tintin is already involved in the mystery when Professor Calculus is kidnapped and put aboard a steamer bound for Peru. With Snowy and Captain Haddock in tow, Tintin arrives in South America ready to rescue his friend and solve the mystery of the curse of the Incas. This involves a journey through the Andes Mountains and the jungles of the rain forest.<br /><br />There is seriousness to what happens in \\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\" and \\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" that reflects a significant turning point in Herg&eacute;'s work. The point that Europeans need to respect the cultures of other peoples is not only explicitly articulated by Tintin in these volumes, but is reinforced by the attention to details he puts into Tintin's visit to foreign lands. The ability of Herg&eacute; to grow as a storyteller over the course of his distinguished career is impressive and these stories deserve the accolades they have received and the affection with which they have been embraced by generations of readers. I have always liked his foray into science fiction with the two-part Moon story, but Herg&eacute; never did anything any better than this Incan epic. \\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" also has one of Herg&eacute;'s best running gags: no, not the perpetual confrontations between Captain Haddock and the llamas, but the attempt by the Thom(p)sons to use dowsing to help solve the case.ppens in \\"The Seven Crytal Balls\\" and \\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" that reflects a significant turning point in Herg's work, laying the ground work for his greatest tales, the two-part Moon story and \\"Tintin in Tibet.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" concludes the epic Tintin adventure as the Sanders-Hardiman Ethnographic Expedition returns from a trip to Peru and Bolivia exploring Inca burial chambers when all seven members fell into comas induced by mysterious crystal balls.

I have enjoyed all of his storys since I read Arundel years ago.  He was a masterful storyteller, and his knowledge of the history and culture of the times is unequaled.  I have long felt that his books are timeless and should be required reading in both high school and college.  He wrote fiction, but you cannot get a similar feeling for the times and people in any history book.  He brought to life the great leaders of this period such as Arnold, Schyler, Roberts, Thompson, and so many others in a way no history book could.  All of his books are great reads and worthy of our attention.  Oliver Wiswell is unique to Roberts and perhaps to American literature.  I had never considered \\"the other side\\" of the revolution.  We were taught about the great patriots, but loyalists and the likes of Benedict Arnold were always traitors.  This book reveals the fallacy of that teaching.  It also shows the great tragedy that was the American Revolution.  I had never considered it to be another civil war, but that was precisely what it was.  The \\"patriots\\" were not that different from the \\"loyalists\\", and in many cases they were worse.  The darkest and most ugly part of that civil war was the division that was borne between people who equally loved their country.  There are reflections of all of that in our times as politicians in the name of freedom and democracy seek to divide us.  The lessons of history are for all times.  Anyway, you MUST read this book.	2005-10-12

I don't own a Nordhavn 62 (I wish) and my seafaring is limited to adolescent adventures in my small sailing skiff and the occasional offshore fishing trip, venturing out not much past 20 miles from the shore. I had followed the adventures of the Nordhavn sponsored 18-boat convoy on the Trawler Transat website where I  read Ken Williams' fascinating emails of his experiences on the Sans Souci, his Nordhavn 62 in the \\"fast boat\\" portion of the expedition. This book is NOT a further revision of Jim Leishman's (Nordhavn CEO)1993 update of Beebe's 1975 \\"bible\\" for power boat circumnavigators.  <br /> <br />It is not an edited digest of his informative emails, but rather a compilation of them. This said, they are quite useful in that Williams is not an experienced offshore navigator, but admits that prior to this venture, his trips have been limited to sight-of-land excursions offshore, never exceeding 8 hours. They upgraded to the N62 simply because they wanted an eminently seaworthy vessel capable of handling whatever rough seas they might encounter in their short hops. So the book is written in an accessible style, from the vantage point of a retired software designer who needed a lot of hand-holding on this bold adventure. The group of 18 were, as the origin might indicate, largely made up of Nordhavns, though it was not limited to craft from that builder.  <br /> <br />Notwithstanding the journal format, the book contains a lot of information on how to prepare, provision, and maintain a power boat on a long-diatance cruise spanning open ocean. There are some overview or stock-taking synopses as well as other viewpoints, such as that of the chef and Ken Williams' wife Roberta.  <br /> <br/>All in all, an informative, entertaining and salty tale and a <br />good one or two evening's read. The ample photos nicely complement the text. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

As an aspiring AT thru-hiker, the day-to-day journal style taught me quite a bit about what the daily grind would be like. However, the prose and the grammar just about killed me on every page. Exclamation points are used like salt, and dull, pointless paragraphs are prodigiously used to essentially say, \\"I hiked all day.\\" There was essentially no ending - even the obvious climax of ascending Mt. Katahdin is glossed over. No personal information is given, and although this might have been an intentional point by the author, it makes a lot of his adventures vague and boring - instead of knowing *who* is hiking, all we know is, as mentioned above, that he is an aging educator that enjoys hiking. And has a daughter that enjoys hiking, too.    That being said, if you are truly aspiring to thru-hike the AT, this book has some useful information.

It started very slowly for me and I almost added it to the maybe someday stack.<br /><br /> If I had stopped after the first 30 or 40 pages I would probably have given it 1 or 2 stars also, but the chapter on meta tells is some of the freshest thinking on poker to come along in quite a while and very useful in the real world. It goes beyond the basic tells of Mike Caro's book but you need to have read Caro's book to fully appreciate this one. I would also agree that the writing is not as good as one would think given the author's academic background and I did find myself rereading numerous sections because of lack of flow. This is why only 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br /> One other thing, the section on meta tells is really the entire value of the book in my opinion but you need to wade through the earlier portions of the book as they lay the foundation for the meta tells section. This approach to using tells and refining them based on player personality is fascinating and useful.<br /><br /> Overall a very insightful and useable book if you can get past the slow start. Don't quit too soon and you will have some excellent new tools to add to your poker toolbox.	2005-10-12

It is right up Sterling's alley-the individual against the state, and his right to revolt.<br /><br />Of course this book has elements of other dystopian literature:  big government and small humans, retrograde technology, and state control of life, liberty, and sex.  This seems like a rehash of the usual works (\\"The Iron Heel,\\" \\"THX-1138,\\" \\"Logan's Run, \\" \\"Harrison Bergeron\\"), but keep in mind it was written in 1937, five years AFTER \\"Brave New World,\\" and  eleven years BEFORE \\"1984.\\"<br /><br />In fact, this book in many ways surpasses Orwell's classic.  Being a novella, it is crisper, punchier, and more to the point. It has less deadwood (the sex scene are allusions), and focuses on the moral aspects of an omnipresent state that has eliminated the word \\"We.\\"<br /><br />That is the key. Eleven years before Appleforth refused to eliminate the word \\"God,\\" the World Council had eliminated the word \\"I.\\"  For day to day activity, that is like removing the letter \\"e.\\"  Throughout the narrative, which is written in first person, Equality 7-2521  keeps referring to himself as \\"we.\\"<br /><br />This makes for awkward reading, since we do not know if he is along or with Liberty 5-3000, or anyone else. But that is point: the objective of the World Council is to eliminate the concept of individuality in order to cement control over society.<br /><br />You do not need a whole Newspeak dictionary if you can eliminate this one word for the vocabulary. This one small change makes all the difference.<br /><br />*<br /><br />The only drawback is that Peikoff included the galley prints of Rand's revision of the First Edition. This uselessly doubles the size of the book, but it is an important insight for fans of Rand and those who are aspiring writers.  If you liked \\"Romantic Manifesto\\" and \\"The Art of Fiction,\\" buy this book. You see Rand's mind in action.	2005-10-12

Interestingly enough the details of the war in Cuba support my memories of those events, although \\"battles\\" is mistranslated to describe all military actions however small.  Cowardice of the Marianas reported by such as Norberto Fuentes (see below), and is not consistent with my memories that recall these women as being irrationally brave, but such is the fog of war.  On the other hand Puebla portrays a courageous Castro an exaggeration of reality, since his caution and discrete retirement from the battle field is legendary. <br /> <br /> <br />Fuentes, Norberto 2004 La Autobiografia de Fidel Castro (Paperback).

Define strategic factors, stakeholders analysis, the importance of defining strategic factors/objectives for each stakeholders group, not only for clients/customers. In this way we are going to define strategic factors for shareholdres, employees, and other stakeholders groups. This process is well known to ones familiar with Project Managament Body of Knowledge from Project Management Institute.   Readers advanced in Strategy Formulation and Performance Management might find several useful ideas. Intermediate readers can learn how to better define objectives, to design a strategy and implement it. Readers which are begginers in the subject might find a lot of interesting and new topics to explore. Nice and pleasant book, with a lot of examples from real world.    PS. In the book are several places where is written \\"if you'd like assistance... our organization has developed...\\". To say this and present the company once, it is OK.

I never realized the impact that properly groomed and trimmed eyebrows can do for a face until I read this book. I had never given much thought to my eyebrows other than to make sure they didn't overgrow and look ugly. However, I was never satisfied by my eyebrows and always found them lacking. It was the weak link in my made-up face. After reading this book and buying a few inexpensive supplies, I'm happy to say that I know what to do for my brows and I love the finished look my makeup now has. (And I didn't need to use stencils!)<br /><br />The information obtained in this book makes it possible for any woman to have neat, attractive eyebrows that are best shaped for her own face. Nancy Parker also advises on what to do if you have more pronounce facial features, such as widely spaced  eyes or a dominant nose. She also helps you figure out which type of eyebrow makeup will work best for your existing brows to get the look you want. (Brow powder vs. brow pencil, what color, etc.)<br /><br />Because this book reads so quickly, you'll be off and ready to do your own eyebrows before you know it. However, please take the time to you make your plan of action before you start plucking (or waxing) away - it will be so worth it! Stencils are not required.<br /><br />The b/w photos are nothing sophisticated, but they serve the point of showing the impact of what brows can do.<br /><br />After reading this book, I've never been able to look at brows the same again now that I know how much they can affect the face. I now see the brow effect in every model and magazine ad I come across.<br /><br />Beautiful Brows is a great book for the average laywoman who wants to gain knowledge on how to manage and make beautiful her own eyebrows.

The good news is numerous plot lines advance and the writing shows the effect of a full editing cycle.  The bad news is that the good writing here oddly illuminates how much of a hole author Robert Jordan dug for himself with the mess of the previous novels - with it being made very clear even a writer of his talent probably won't be able to resolve the plethora of details even with another couple of books.  I take a star off for letting a number of details and characters slip along with another half star for a pace that at times returns to near-plodding, but I'll round it up from 3.5 stars to four for the progress here that makes me have high hopes for the next book.    It is outright scary to think of how many top selling authors have come and gone since Jordan started this series.  In 1990, Lemony Snicket was a sophomore in college, J. K. Rowling had just taken that fateful train ride back to London, and most of the top sellers on the sci-fi/fantasy lists hadn't been published even in fan magazines.  My rating here is standalone and does not reflect my frustration with how Jordan has dragged this out; read my reviews of Crossroads and New Spring if you doubt that.  (Incidentally, Jordan claims to never have read a review on Amazon, having stated that \\"if you're going to get your heart checked out, would you go to a doctor (professional reviewer) or walk up to a guy on the street?\\"  Oh well.)    Although not spectacular, Knife of Dreams finally gives hope again.  Without spoiling things, many plotlines raised in the last few books advance.  Perrin's attempts to recover Faile, Mat's escape with and courtship of Tuon, Elayne's struggle for her crown, and a few miscellaneous issues resolve.  More significantly and more satisfyingly, Jordan really does make progress on some plotlines that have been promised since the first few books - Egwene's struggle to truly be the Amyrlin Seat, the implications of Lan as Aan'allein, and miraculously, even some movement on the long (1995!) dormant Eel- and Aelfinn plotline.  There are also some remarkable new point-of-view (Tuon, Loial!) perspectives that add to the details of the world without having to write hundreds of pages.  Finally, the book also shows the effort of being at Tor for more than a month before publication like the last four or five novels; Jordan isn't allowed to go off into tangents - and thankfully, no major new characters get introduced - and in general the writing is generally crisper.    Unfortunately, it's not enough.  Jordan has created so many irrelevant plotlines and characters from the sixth book onwards that even with a workmanlike effort to clean up here the mess is still very much present.  A glaring result is that the main plot - what the Dragon Reborn is doing - not only receives merely cursory attention but also doesn't show up until Chapter 18, or 385 pages into a 760 page book.  The not-particularly-engaging Windfinder and Tower-divided stories get far too much coverage without moving much, a number of major characters besides Rand (like Min, Nynaeve, and Aviendha) get very little stage time with more minor players like Galina and various Shaido characters receiving far too much, other interesting plots like the Forsaken move barely at all with minimal coverage, and of all the advancements above only the Egwene line really feels satisfying.  (If Jordan had advanced the other main characters as much as Egwene this would have been a much better book.)  The problem is clear.  The last really good WoT book, Fires of Heaven, had roughly four or five major plotlines; this has at least ten thanks to the mess of the last few books.  While Jordan and his editor state unequivocally that this will be finished in one more book (thankfully planned to be completed before any more prequels), all the new material he's added makes this doubtful and is now standing directly in the way of a great wrapup.    Jordan's goal was to have fans sweating by the end of the book; for me, I didn't get there as this doesn't qualify as a cliffhanger by any means.  Over the summer, I actually reread all the previous books and the good news is the bad ones make more sense as part of a sequential order - and at least Jordan is somewhere close to his old form, so this isn't bad.  But then again, it's not great either.  Still, it deserves 3.5 stars and is worth buying in hardcover rather than waiting.  For the first time in years, I look forward to the next novel.    September 2007: My sympathies to Jordan's lovely wife Harriet on his recent passing.  For those who are interested, the notes he left as the basis of the massive final book, A Memory of Light, will be completed and published in 3 separate books by Brandon Sanderson.	2005-10-12

If you think al Qaeda is bad news, let me introduce you to Imperial Japan, a xenophobic society of death-worshipping nationalist religious fanatics.  Leo Daugherty describes the Japanese soldier in 95 pages divided into six chapters:<br /><br />--martial tradition<br /><br />--induction and training<br /><br />--military organization<br /><br />--tactics<br /><br />--individual weapons and equipment<br /><br />--Japanese infantry division support weapons<br /><br />Want to know what motivated the Imperial Japanese soldier to hunker down in a spider hole clutching an unexploded American aircraft bomb and a hammer?  That soldier was going to blow up an American tank-and himself.  The Kamikaze came about when military defeat and lack of war material meshed with the duty of the Japanese soldier to die in battle-if necessary, by killing himself.  Daugherty wrote that the state religion of Shinto and the code of Bushido incorporated in 1867.  Emperor Hirohito was considered a god, and anything done in service to that god was good.  The national goal was unifying the world-under Japanese leadership.  The soldier's code, Senjinkun, was pounded into already-prepared recruits.  A military junta ruled Japan and this junta prepared the Japanese people for total war.  On page 21 a table lists the year-long conscript training cycle-but this wasn't the beginning of military training.  School children were indoctrinated early.  \\"By 1934, more than one-third, or 915,000, of Japan's young men in the appropriate age bracket studied and drilled at these youth training centers.\\"<br /><br />No wonder part of the Japanese Imperial Guards rebelled when Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's capitulation!<br /><br />Japan had no jungles to train in, yet the Japanese soldier was an excellent jungle fighter.  This was the result of long, thorough training.  The Japanese soldier was trained to fight at night as a means of overcoming enemy forces superior in numbers and firepower.  The bayonet and hand grenade were preferred over the rifle-especially for close combat in the dark.<br /><br />I found the descriptions of weapons and equipment brief but useful.  Many criticize the Japanese for having poor small arms, for lacking a submachine gun, for \\"over reliance\\" on the bayonet.  Actually, Japanese rifles and light machine guns were quite effective.  Japanese pistols weren't, and the Type 100 submachine gun was a failure.  The United States didn't really have a good submachine gun either, and its Browning Automatic Rifle was no match for a light machine gun.  The famed knee mortar provided close-in 50mm shellfire on enemy positions.  Oh, perhaps a semiautomatic rifle like America's M-1 Garand would have been nice-provided Japan's industry could keep her soldiers supplied with ammunition.  Unrestricted air and submarine warfare by the United States went a long way towards insuring that there was never enough ammunition for the Japanese defenders.<br /><br />At the division level (roughly 20,000 men-on paper), Japan shortchanged its soldiers on heavy weapons.  No matter-there was a decided lack of motor transport in the Japanese armed forces.  Couldn't haul artillery pieces and ammunition even if they had the hardware-a severe lack of petroleum was one reason Japan attacked the Western nations.  Against lightly-equipped Chinese formations, Japanese units had ample firepower.  When confronted by Soviet armored formations, Japan lost a chunk of Manchuria during 1939 in the Khalkyn Gol Incident.  Initially, Japan crushed more-heavily armed British Commonwealth and American troops, but by 1943 the shoe was on the other foot.  Eventually, islands such as Iwo Jima would bear the full brunt of American air power and naval gunfire unaided-it would just be the Japanese infantryman and a handful of artillery pieces buying time.  Like the Vietnamese Communists of 40 years ago and al Qaeda today, the Japanese soldier believed it was just a matter of time before the soft Americans gave up and crawled back home.  Given the disparity in divisional artillery and in tanks, this was quite the leap of faith!<br /><br />Japan declared war on the whole world and her infantrymen did more than humanly possible.  \\"Fighting Techniques of a Japanese Infantryman\\" describes in general terms how the Japanese infantry achieved this, and the tools that Japan gave its soldiers.r of time before the soft Americans gave up and crawled back home.

He is also progenitor of ordinary language philosophy and ordinary common sense. The sensible world is restored as a first principle; something that cannot be proven, but all must concede exists. And all perception is veridical. The Inquiry captures all the nuances of the five senses as we ordinarily have come to know them. Ditto, reason, which is the focus of the first Essay. Yes, reason can lead one into infinite regress, especially when it comes to causes and effects, but we necessarily rely on some element of reason (conception, imagination, judgment) to give us bearings in the world. The final Essay is on morality. It is the least interesting, if only because Reid appeals to the \\"Author of our being\\" to establish first principles of right and wrong. Even so, humans are endowed naturally with a moral sense so that many of the appeals to God could just as easily be appeals to our endowment by human nature. But the number of his first principles is inordinate.<br /><br />One of the problems with Reid's entire approach is the number of his first principles. I stopped counting after forty. Somehow that many first principles defeats the whole notion of first principle. Even if I agree with Reid that Descartes' starting point, the thinking self, is the wrong first principle, at least Descartes starts with one first principle and deduces others. Likewise, Berkeley and Hume, one to an idealist conclusion, one to a sceptical conclusion. Reid's approach is manifestly opposite. Since he insists so much of what we are consists of numerous first principles, soon the whole notion of \\"first principle\\" loses its meaning. In a sense, to save the rest of ordinary language and common sense philosophy, he must abuse the ordinary notion of \\"first principle.\\"<br /><br />Somehow, there needs to be a better balance. Surely, that man is sentient can itself be a first principle, and that man is a rational animal can be another, and from these two, the others can be deduced. Maybe not. That's the predicament of modern philosophy.other, and from these two, the others can be deduced. Maybe not. That's the predicament of modern philosophy.	2005-10-12

In order to have such a dialogue, an electric shock was given to the \\"client\\" in order to dislodge the spirit, who was then allowed to \\"control\\" Mrs. Wickland for a certain period of time (she became like a surrogate body to these spirits).  Mr. Wicland then began a series of questions in an effort to determine who the spirit was, and why they were obsessing that particular patient - or for that matter, why they were obsessing at all...<br /><br />Also included in this book are hefty discussions on skepticism, religion & atheism - all generally interesting, but sometimes a bit wordy.<br /><br />The one thing I did not like about \\"The Gateway\\" was the author's tendency to put down other people's beliefs.  It appeared that if other's received info. that was counter to what he had received, then his view was that the other person's info. was given by an ignorant spirit, and so he was \\"right\\".  I found this amusing considering the fact that he dealt with what he called \\"ignorant spirits\\" on a daily basis - as these are the ones that tend to obsess - yet he felt that the info. he received, or what he surmised from this info., was somehow of a higher level than what anyone else could receive.<br /><br />The author also had a tendency to put down religion, and those who believe in religion - regardless of what that religion may be.  This tendency may offend some readers.<br /><br />Overall, I have given this book 4 stars because, even though I disagree with some of Wickland's conclusions, and the overall sense of his views are that his are superior, this book does provide a wealth of information for the spiritual student to ponder, and it's written in such a way that it's easy to understand & interesting.  Plus, there aren't many spiritual books out there of this length and comprehensivness where one could say that they agree with everything that was written - that's just par for the course...<br /><br />It's my belief that all books of a spiritual nature have something to offer - but it's like the blind trying to describe an elephant - your experience depends on where you're \\"standing\\" at the time & what you're feeling.

Temporal procesing. Consciousness.  Subject these areas to orderely analysis and the neurl correlates of consciousness are vaguely hoving into view.  This essentially is the strategy pursued in the book. Since the visual cortex has received an enormous amount of scrutiny, the book has a rich stream of theory and result to draw upon.  Secondly, the connection between visual processing and attention has long been noted in early infant development - joint attention being a developmental milestone.  A range of studies of various brain insults have indicated that impaired temporal processing affects the unity of report self-awareness.  So far the book is on the winning track. However, when it comes to grounding consciousness the evidence is much thinner.  There is a still a huge amount about the brain we simply do not understand, e.g. from what kind of computational model (if any) is appropriate to the function and organisation of large ranges of nuclei.  Koch has shielded himself somehat by sticking with largely established results.  There is an amount of question-begging nevertheless.  Overall the latter fifty pages focus on the NCC idenitifcation probelsm and in line with our lack of knowledge, the coverage is patchy. One naggign question that is not addressed is whether consciousness is the 'same' for everyone? For example, research into autism, congential blindness and congenital deafness has revealed that the world of people and self are apprehended differently. It would have been interesting to have Koch's views on the 'consciousness' of the impaired mind - or impaired brain.<br /><br />While I found the book intersting to read I was not very satisfied at the end of it.  A savannah of philosophical questions are simply overlooked.  Secondly, many paragraphs and arguments are prefixed with the phrase 'Francis and I...'  This was entirely unnecesary and suggested either grandiosity or else a thinness of argument that needed the heft of the fame of a historical figure to get it through the door. It would be very intersting to read another edition of this book where more weight was given to the philosophical and computational conundrums that accompany eliminativist thinking.

Having delved into a number of home-study language courses, I can say without hesitation that this is the best I have ever seen. The approach to learning Portuguese is extremely effective. The student is given grammar points and new vocabulary in small, easy-to-understand doses and given plenty of practice in using and internalizing them. The course also gives considerable attention to the pronunciation of Portuguese vowels, such as the difference between \\"open\\" and \\"closed\\" vowel sounds. The amount of vocabulary in the course is not great, but the student is given such a strong command of grammar and pronunciation that constructing sentences is very easy, and new vocabulary can be picked up later. There is also a Portuguese Level 2 available (for $275, but well worth it!), which deals more extensively with vocabulary and more advanced grammatical structures. It is available from Audio-Forum and 101language.com on tape and CD (but steer clear of the CD version-it is set up so there is only one track per lesson and you cannot backtrack or review! Stick with the tapes.) After only three months of studying Level 1 and a few units of Level 2, I am amazed at how much I can say in Portuguese. If you want to learn this beautiful and fun language, the FSI courses are the best investment you can make.	2005-10-12

He drives, his buddy does the shooting. To Johnny, the victim is not a person, but Johnny's \\"new transmission\\" for his car. He's a slimeball, and thus far rendered believable, ala Elmore Leonard. There is a reference that, as a youth, he had a thirst for knowledge, and that he had at one time read good books. Aside from this, Johnny gives no sense of authority, high intelligence, or competency. Then his uncle, who wants to take over the world's heroin market, decides to use Johnny as his representative in the biggest (and least plausible ) dope deal in the history of crime fiction. Suddenly Johnny, who's making twenty-five grand a year in a union job, is transformed into a wizard with the ability to: <br /> 1- Negotiate a billion dollar drug deal with a stereotyped crafty, unfathomable Chinese Triad boss <br /> 2- Has a tremendous facility with numbers <br /> 3- Is knowledgeable about international banking, finance, the Asian drug market, crops, weapons systems, customs brokerage, and much much much more ( he can do no wrong, make no false step ) <br /> 4- Is conversant with, and actively thinks about, Dante, Socrates ( whom he criticizes as arrogant for his admonition to \\"Know thyself\\", since knowing oneself is impossible), and Milton's Paradise Lost. <br />  There is no sense of irony to tell us this is all meant as parody. Rather, Toshces presents this in a serious tone, with a lot of \\"deep\\" perception from the previously thuggish Johnny, that alerts the reader to the fact that Johnny is really Tosches' representative more than his uncle's; it is the author's concerns put into Johnny's mind, and as such they become, especiallyin the penultimate chapter, more pretentious than they would have if we had been given a realistic character who was fully developed. Johnny loses all credibility, as does the preposterous plot.  <br />   Tosches is very talented. He has done abundant research. With the Chinese Triads he had a good subject that wasn't written to death. But all this was lost under the creaky, potboiler plot and the unbelievable Johnny.  <br />   Johnny tells us there is no good or evil, but tries to convince us he's a nice guy anyway. To rationalize shipping billions of dollars of heroin into New York, he says the drug addicts deserve it. \\"If the scum of humanity craved heroin, so be it. Let the self-oppressors go down together, down to the wasteland of gutted souls and assembly-line minds.\\" And he calls Socrates arrogant?	2005-10-12

Also I have \\"JavaScript & DHTML Cookbook\\" by same author and was not happy with it. <br /> <br />Before I bought the book, I would look up everything I needed info on, in the online index and found *EVERYTHING*.  I did the same for a number of other Javascript books and most of the stuff wasn't in their index. <br /> <br />First let me say that I am an Engineer with 20+ years experience so though I'm pretty new to JavaScript, I'm an expert in a number of languages. <br /> <br />I found this book to be very well organized and incredibly helpful.  I haven't tried reading it as a book cover to cover, and at 1200 pages (plus bonus chapters on CD) I never will. I use it as a reference and read just enough to understand what I need to do.  As a result I'm coming at the book not as a novice but with enough understanding to have basic ideas of what I want to do.  For this type of usage, this book is \\"fantastic\\".   <br /> <br />The CD is awesome.  There are a number of bonus chapters (one which was very useful to me...using XmlHTTPRequest), and having the entire book available as a pdf is a totally great way to do searches.  Too bad the .pdf is too big to be readable on my clie. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.	2005-10-12

This short book (70 pages of text) is Holmes' essay on the theory, origins of, developmental trajectory of, and end results of both healthy and unhealthy narcissism.  It is remarkably free from jargon, so it is appropriate for the lay person, but also has enough references to guide the college student or early graduate student.  The writing is quite good, in contrast to most of the stuff I have read on narcissism.<br /><br />I also liked the linking of the psychoanalytic concepts in narcissism to examples from literature (Ovid, Oscar Wilde, for example), and, of course, the Greek story itself.<br /><br />This short book took about two hours to read carefully.	2005-10-12

The trees are described in their summer and winter aspects.  It is a fine reference book not a book to be used in the field to identify trees.  You should have an idea which general family of tree you are looking at to narrow the search down as the trees are arranged according to family.  At the beginning of each tree description is a section listing those characteristics that are most helpful in identifying the tree.  There is also a section at the end comparing the tree to those with which it is most likely to be confused. A glossary of terms is given at the back of the book and dichotomous keys to the families are given at the front.  At the beginning of each family more detailed dichotomous keys are given to help the reader distinguish one member of the family from another.  Leaf shapes and edges as well as types of fruits, flowers, and buds are illustrated to help the reader understand terminology used in the descriptions  <br />    Although trees of Eastern North America is the subject of the book, it is not devoted only to native trees of the area.	2005-10-12

He wrote a successful novel based on that experience, but then declined into writing potboilers under a pen name.  Now he is rediscovering himself.  Some bottles of Joe's homemade wine, salvaged from Pog Hill, seem to have mysterious properties, and lead Jay into the impulse buying of a French chateau in Lansquenet, where he joins into the smalltown atmosphere and begins to write a new novel.<br /><br />The story alternates between memories of Pog Hill, the small town he lost (converted into upscale housing developments) and Lansquenet, the small town he has found and wants to keep.  All is not as it seems in Lansquenet, especially with his neighbor, and forces are at work to make the town into another tourist destination.  Jay finds himself caught up in events, and drinking Joe's wine (his \\"specials\\") seems to bring back Joe, and redirects Jay's life.<br /><br />There is something about the specials, and unexpected value in Joe's seed collection.  There is more than one way to revive a town that is in decline.  And the blackberry wine, well, that is the last bottle, and you have to read the novel to get there.	2005-10-12

It would not surprise me if that person was arrogant, egotistical, sexist, or worse.  He himself suffered from this egotism to the point of contemplating suicide. <br /> <br />I think it's be safe to assume that the person that emerged from that single transformative experience, lived his teaching for twenty years and began to write it down only recently, bears little relation to the person you knew. <br /> <br />Though I've never met Mr. Tolle, I can imagine that the personality of a fully-realized, or \\"enlightened\\" human being might still manage to offend certain people.  The enlightened state is one of both detachment and great compassion; ironically, the detachment of egolessness can easily be misinterpreted as egotism.  I believe Ramana Maharshi appeared that way to some.  See the Tao te Ching (Stephen Mitchell translation) for a more detailed description of such a person. <br /> <br />And once again, even if Mr. Tolle could not embody his teaching 100% of the time, it detracts nothing from his works.  The proof of the value of his teaching lies in the lives transformed by it, such as mine, from one of brooding, self-involvment, and pain, to lightness, joy and ease.   <br /> <br />Pick up a copy and give it a try.  Just keep reading it, and try to live with the teaching.   <br /> <br />Review: I have not read this new book yet, but thus far the original is my favorite book.  I can go back time and again.  In Stillness Speaks, Tolle experimented with a more concise, poetic style that I believe did not suit him as well as his extended discourses.  From the sounds of things, his new book goes back to that original style.	2005-10-12

Although this is not a particularly quick read (and a bit dry),  <br /> <br />it is very informative.  It is less about Morgan Spulocks debut film \\"Super-Size Me\\" and more about fast food, junk food over eating and nutrition.  One  <br /> <br />thing I particularly like about this book is that he goes in to detail about the caloric content of many fast foods going as far as comparing the caloric  <br /> <br />intake of a meal at one fast food establishment to another which yield some surprising results.  What you think is a healthy dining choice may not be at  <br /> <br />all.  Morgan stresses the importance of eating whole foods and home cooked meals.  \\"Don't Eat This Book's\\" message is simple; If you eat good healthy food  <br /> <br />and exercise you will be a healthy person, if you do the opposite you will not live a healthy and happy life.  I reccomend this to anyone interested in  <br /> <br />nutrition, health or obesity!	2005-10-12

Morgan's provocative third novel even begins, he dedicates it to \\"all those, globally, whose lives have been wrecked or snuffed out by the Great Neoliberal Dream and Slash-and-Brun Globalization\\". He also makes sure the reader knows he drew inspiration from left-wing extremists like Noam Chomsky, John Pilger and Michael Moore. The reader, upon encountering this, could be forgiven for slipping the book quietly back on the shelf with a slight shake of the head. But that would be a mistake. <br /> <br />Despite the ideological chest-thumping, \\"Market Forces\\" is not just a wisp of a story wrapped around a shrill anti-capitalist polemic. It's actually a rollicking good read that doesn't get swamped by the author's ideological crusade, except perhaps near the end. But more on that later. <br /> <br />The setting is deliciously twisted. Fifty years from now, the world is run by a handful of financial houses that deal in \\"conflict investment\\" -- giving financial assistance to tinpot dictators in exchange for a cut of the country's GDP if they stay in power. Executives vie for promotion or contract tenders by staging highway duels in armored cars. It's a bizzare mixture -- \\"Liar's Poker\\" meets \\"Mad Max\\" -- but Morgan deftly pulls it off. <br /> <br />Morgan's first novel proved that he is adept at drawing imperfect characters, and here he serves up a whole cast of scummy anti-heros and scummier villians. Chris Faulkner fought his way up from the slums and is a new hotshot executive. His wife, Carla, is a mechanic who keeps his sedan in prime dueling condition. Her father is an idealistic outcast whose socialist views are a constant source of tension in the family. Along the way, Chris falls in with a media vixen, a chummy but brutal partner, and a team of envious colleagues intent on seeing the newcomer go down in flames, quite literally if it should come to that. <br /> <br />The action ticks over nicely as Chris careens between stoking conflicts in Cambodia and Latin America, terrorizing street thugs with Mike, and grinding rival investors into scrap metal under the bumper of his armored Saab. All the while he is trying to rescue his foundering marriage and avoid the plasticene temptations of Liz, a powerful journalist tracking his career. <br /> <br />While Morgan's conclusions on the nature of the modern geo-political/economic system may be black and white, he lays it out for us through shades of gray. The rapacious corporations are clearly the bad guys, but characters like Mike are strangely charismatic, and it's easy to cheer the suits when they wield their power to wipe out white supremacists or permanently cripple an abusive husband for beating his wife. Likewise, those characters with the \\"right\\" socialist viewpoints are quick to espouse their ideals but are too weak or scared to act on them. <br /> <br />Morgan's contention that capitalism is inherently brutal and self-destructive only starts to become obvious in the last part of the book as Chris repeatedly snubs chances for redemption and mires himself deeper in the brutal corporate culture he once held at arm's length. But the book works despite this late-game heavy-handedness, and while I might have wished for a cheerier conclusion, I have to give credit to Morgan for pushing things to what he must see as their logical conclusion, insofar as that logic works in the fantasy version of capitalism and globalization he has constructed. <br /> <br />This *is* a sci-fi book, after all.	2005-10-12

It doesn't have much information on centuries prior to the twentieth and largely focuses on art, artists, and issues from the 1960's on, so it wouldn't do as the only text for such a course. But this is all you need for late twentieth century concerns.<br /><br />The early essays are dripping with Freudian psychology and psychoanalytical social criticism. The issues surrounding why it took so long for there to be a sense of equality of greatness amongst artists of all genders is explored deeply. The issues of representation of all races and sexual orientations then follows. The book stops just short of discussing the newest research on intersex persons (persons born with an extra chomosome, among others {XXY, for example}).<br /><br />For a movement that was intending to create a sense of equality, feminist theory highlights both the vast differences as well as the profound similarities between the perception processes of men and women. This includes both the perceptions of and different approaches to art as well as life. Yet, when all is said and done, more recent artists are primarily interested not in these issues, but more a sense of having their work judged based on its quality, not their gender.<br /><br />The only disappointment I have in this book is one that no other book addresses either. So, I mean this only as a minor criticism. In short, the book does not answer the following: Is ther an intersex mind state? Feminist theory either didn't reach the point of asking this in time for the extensive research put into this book or it has come to its conclusion and will transform gradually into a whole other movement.<br /><br />The art chosen to represent the above ideas and explorations is top quality. The reproductions are sharp and colorful. I would recommend this book to anyone with interests in women in art or in feminist theory.	2005-10-11

The author does not mistake socialism for totalitarianism. Historical socialism is the religious belief that if you steal property from every individual and hand it to the state (who defines the state?), people will magically become better human beings -- all will be egalitarian, err equal.<br /><br />Socialism is state religion forced on the individual by its believers. Simple. Stealing any form of property from those who earn to hand it out to those who did not is pure theft.

Indeed, some seem unaware that he has written other books, at all.  Halperin's Ph.D. is in Classics, as in all things ancient Greek and Roman, not English or Queer Theory.  He has been a Classics professor in a Department of Classics.  I once had a Classics professor who had been his advisee as either an undergraduate or graduate student, I don't recall which.  He gravitated to Queer Theory only sometime thereafter.  He has written a book largely about the history of male-male sex in antiquity, _One Hundred Years of Homosexuality and Other Essays in Greek Love_, which is both well-known and standard reading in the field, in which he largely follows Kenneth Dover.  As far as I know, and I am surmising from what I have read, he now teaches in an English department only because: (a) he has become somewhat disenchanted with sexual-identity politics in Classics departments, (b) he is now much more interested in Queer Theory, though he continues to address antiquity in the occasionally plublished essay, some of which have also become standard in the field, (c) many Queer Theorists have gravitated to English departments, and, (d) as a Classics Ph.D., he is well qualified to teach ancient literature.   <br /> <br />Though I choose not to adopt Halperin's suggestions in this book in their entirety, I do see a very great deal worth either adopting or rigorously considering in this book.  I particularly enjoy his treatment of the controversies and shady dealings surrounding Bernadette Brooten and Amy Richlin.	2005-10-11

This edition adds some chapters to Geza Vermes' (1983) Jesus and the World of Judaism.  Most of the essays date back to the 70s and 80s.  The Qumran related ones are more recent (1996, 1999) and the reflection in the final chapter is taken from Vermes' autobiography, published in 1998.<br /><br />Vermes is now mainstream, though it appears that thirty years ago this was not the case.  He argues for an historical approach, in contrast to what he calls a theological approach.  Whereas the latter would focus on Jesus in his New testament context and regard the rest of what was happening in the intertestamental years as background, Vermes takes the opposite view.  It is more historically valid and enlightening, in his view, to begin with what we know of the temporal and spatial setting and work back to the representation of Jesus in the synoptic gospels.  From that point we can excavate what we think represents actual speech and events in the life of Jesus and what is constructed by the evangelists (ie the synoptics, not John, which Vermes believes has almost no historical validity at all).<br /><br />I have said that I believe that Vermes is now mainstream - not necessarily that all his conclusions are accepted by the scholarly community, but that a more historically deductive approach is now common.  By historical deduction I refer to the process of discovery proceeding from the general historical context to the particular events and characters to be discovered.  My belief is not based on expertise, and is open to challenge from those who know better.  However, I recently completed a course in biblical studies at a Catholic university that used extensively recent scholarship that did exactly what Vermes was arguing for in the 70s and 80s, ie placed gospel-based interpretations firmly in the context of the time and place of their writing and of the broader contemporary Jewish world.  I would think it difficult for New Testament scholars now writing for a wider community to begin with a theological position and then proceed simply to find justification for it.<br /><br />Vermes writes well and with a degree of passion.  There is a degree of polemicism in his style.  His wit and pleasure in pith have got him into trouble with sober scholars who have taken him to task for insufficient deference to method or unsubtle summative statements.  This book begins with a self-defence from criticism by John Meier arising from a Vermes attempt to be humorous.  At another time he argues that people misrepresent him for understanding statements such as \\"Jesus was a Galilean Hasid\\" (p. 10) as implying that that's all he was, but it's not an unreasonable inference when considered in the light of Vermes' argument as a whole.  On other occasions, Vermes does make the explicit point that he thinks Jesus was in fact a Galilean Hasid, like Honi and Hanina ben Dosa, but much more as well (though still within the parameters of Hasidism).<br /><br />I have found the three books I've read by Vermes on Jesus enlightening and very readable.  They have helped me greatly to understand Jesus in his Jewish context without in any way lessening my faith in the value of Jesus' mission and its subsequent development in the mission of the Church.  I believe Vermes would see this as a reasonable outcome of his message to the reader.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my Fortress Press paperback copy ordered through Amazon fell apart almost immediately.  I've not come across such a poorly bound book in many years.  I hope it was a one-off, as I know Fortress Press is a quality publisher.  I have let them know.y to begin with a theological position and then proceed simply to find justification for it.<br /><br />Vermes writes well and with a degree of passion.

For what it is - no fuss, no muss, quick and easy cooking - this is a very good book.<br /><br />I resisted buying this one for awhile. I LOVE to cook and found it insulting at first, a book that relied so heavily on pre-made store bought ingredients ... then I started working full time and found that some days (okay, five out of seven of them!) I just do not have the time to cook as \\"in-depth\\" as I like to. So, rather than relying on re-heated homemade cooking (there's only so many times you can eat the same soup or chili) or constantly resorting to resturants, I gave this one a shot.<br /><br />The ideas are great; the menus built with recipes that compliment one another. Granted, they aren't very creative in the cooking process ... but that's something I adjust to fit my needs. A recipe calls for bottled sauce? I thaw some of my homemade sauce the night before. No fresh herbs added to a recipe when I think they'd really make the flavor pop? Well, then I just add some! Store bought cornbread? Pssh - I can at least take an extra 20 minutes to bake some from a mix! I don't follow every \\"recipe\\" to the letter; I make substitions with fresh foods when I have the time and the ingredients.<br /><br />All told, this is a great book to fall back on when things get hectic or to thumb through when you're looking for ideas.	2005-10-11

Over the years since this, and many other stories by Barks, have appeared, they have come in many formats, of which the best is the COLLECTED  WORKS OF CARL BARKS, and now this series, including this title, comes in a nicely done cover, with Library  quality paper. I have copies of this in a previous  incarnation of the GLADSTONE  prints, prior to the Publishers going bust. Thankfully, someone has realised that these titles are being bought by Adults who could not afford the collected works, but who wanted a title done in a collectable  format that would last. Way too many versions of this title published since the late 50's and again in the 70s have been done on poor quality paper, and were  priced  accordingly.  This Ancient Persia  title works  well in this comic format, however, some of the titles  occurred originally in a strip format, and suffer when transferred  to the comic page format. However, I managed to get some of these titles in a \\"hard\\" cover binding that preserved the strip ratio, without resorting to the comic page ratio that was edited with apparently  little  thought ( these editions in original strip format came out about 1982-84, and as far as I am aware are not currently available anywhere... so I hope someone can examine some of the original  formats, and see what best goes back to the strip format).

US	51679215	R196SX9FB8DGQ1	0966484908	715296953	The Crucifixion Conspirators	Books	4	0	1	N	Y	Better than expected	This book's premise is based on the same research that Dan Brown's famous novel (The Davinici Code) is based on, and in many ways it is a more interesting story.  Where Brown concentrates much of his story on esoteric art and puzzle solving, Conspirators is more of an action story with time traveling heroes.  The time traveling technology is sketchy at best, but it serves its purpose well enough, which is to get a team of adventurers to the distant past to witness and record the crucifixion if Christ.  What they find is both astonishng and controversial, at least to some team members.  And they struggle with the fate of the information.  The book was written 7 years ago and shows its age, especially in the technology area.  Microcircuitry was certainly not the author's forte.  If this story were revised and marketed better, I believe it would have mass appeal.  Even though it tackles a touchy subject, the authenticity of the Jesus Christ miracle, with gusto, it does not preach or rant, but merely observes open-mindedly.	2005-10-11

(Bradford Books)	Books	2	25	27	N	Y	Interesting but replete with hasty argumentation	The main thesis of this book, asserted repetitively, is that the mind is a computer program.  Once this is borne in mind, pardon the alliteration, most of the book is reduced to an argument in its favour, rather than an investigation into its credibility. The book often reaches for blunt assertions to support its positions and only afterwards begins a slight retracing of steps.  For example, we are told that inductive bias and learning algorithms are coded into the genome. It is obvious, bit of speculation on DNA, evolution and algorithms and out comes the result!<br /><br />In his observance of Occam's Razor, the author confuses the appeal of the simplest explanatory hypothesis with the belief that he has found such.  The discussion of neural networks leaves aside recurrent networks, which are probably more biologically plausible than competitors.<br /><br />Likewise the idea that the brain essentially 'runs' compressed programs due to evolutionary endowments is unconvincing and philosophically leaky.<br /><br />I don't want to be over critical of the book as it has brought together many interesting strands of work, but it just has not woven them into anything interesting.  There is little new here, whether from modularity or evolutionary programming constraints on neural activity.  A lot of it is speculative and several of the key themes are discordant due to under analysis of their assumptions.<br /><br />Several of the elaborations verge on the frivolous.  For example, there is a particularly woolly argument linking the learning of Scheme to \\"what goes on in constructing our understanding of the world\\" (p. 222).  Likewsie in discussing awareness and consciousness, the author relies on the use of 'main' in C to metaphorically explain how information might come together in the brain (p. 413-415).  All kinds of reification fallacies come to mind, leaving aside the thinnes of the argument.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the book pursues a strong cognitivist program (the brain is a computer) without convincingly examining various sides of the argument. I was certainly no wiser off at the end of it.gnitivist program (the brain is a computer) without convincingly examining various sides of the argument.

As such, they prayed the PSALMS at all Jewish Holidays and other prayer times practiced by devout Jews.  When Jesus prayed the Psalms as a  Man on Earth, He was praying prayers that many of us have never even considered praying today.  If you want to pray the PRAYERS that Jesus Christ himself prayed, get this book.  In the back of the book there is an appendix that provides schedules for praying the Psalms.  You can put yourself on a weekly, biweekly (every two weeks), or monthly schedule and PRAY ALL of them.  If you're reading this review you know that the PSALMS come from the OLD TESTAMENT of the Bible.  T.M. Moore's book presents all of those PSALMS with a brief INTRODUCTORY NOTE and an ADDITIONAL NEW TESTAMENT reference that echoes the Word of God via the New Testament from the Old Testament Psalmist.  When praying the PSALMS in this book, it is helpful to have the NEW Testament Cross Reference included for further meditation and adding an additional dimension to my/your prayer of the Psalms.	2005-10-11

I've used and advocated the latter book for thirty five years.<br /><br />Action Coaching, and I haven't finished it yet, \\"begins with the end in mind\\". The authors define Action Coaching as \\"a process that fosters self-awareness, resulting in the motivation and the guidance to change in ways that meet organizational needs.\\"  The approach is directly linked to organizational goals and an action plan (both of which are dynamic). There are processes to involve the executive's boss in the process. (Good luck, you say, with getting executives to devote time to such a process!?) Feedback on progress toward important goals and leadership development is valued and seen by the CEO.<br /><br />The book is loaded with tips, tools, exhibits, questions, processes, and ideas for helping a manager become a more effective coach, even without the support of the organization. The authors of Action Coaching  offer forty helpful, easy- to- understand exhibits that: serve as diagnostic tools, offer suggestions on handling difficult situations, provide checklists of to-do's,  feature evaluation and role-playing tools, etc.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be helpful to have a resource where the processes and approach had been successfully field tested in corporations with real executives, with real CEO's who had extremely important strategic challenges ahead of them, and where traditionalist leadership paradigms and behaviors made it impossible to accomplish the articulated goals? That is precisely what these authors did in developing and refining their processes and approaches?<br /><br/>What the Action Coaching is not is a lock-step guide, prescribing every important step and nuance along the way toward helping executive leaders grow. It is a particularly interesting, believable, and seemingly sound approach based on the experiences that they have had with major organizations. The process with individuals and with organizations is one that enables both to help themselves, becoming less dependent upon the external coaches, while building coaching expertise internally.<br /><br />This is the best book of coaching I have ever read, and I've read quite a few.<br /><br />Bill Parker<br /><br />Bill Parker Associates<br /><br />A Leadership Development Resource<br /><br />Richmond, VA<br /><br />PS This is the fourth book I have read by David Dotlich and his colleagues within the past six months.

I am glad I read Undaunted Courage.  The Lewis and Clark Expedition is a major part of our history.  The major criticism I have is that I found the \\"mid section\\", where Ambrose recaps the travel diary Lewis recorded during the expedition, too long.  I did get a feeling for what it was like to be on the journey, but perhaps 150-200 pages instead of 300+ pages would have sufficed.<br /><br />On the other hand, by having to slog through the book, you get a sense of the fatigue they endured, but also the excitement.  I suppose a Montana National Park Ranger or Northwest US aficionado or American Indian buff would savor every detailed description.<br /><br />I was just as interested to learn about the events that lead to the expedition as well as what happened to Lewis and Clark and the Louisiana Territory afterward the expedition.  As an early American history buff, I also enjoyed learning about Jefferson's role.<br /><br />It was interesting to read about American Indian life in the Northwest in the early 1800's before the white men invaded their territory and their interaction with Lewis and Clark.  I enjoyed reading Lewis's description of all the new plants and animals and lands he encountered.<br /><br />All in all, even though it was a little longer than I would have wished, the book was worth it.	2005-10-11

There is some well written erotica in this book with good characters, but there are some plot elements that are plain silly.  Now this is fantasy so realism should not be expected; but the idea of oral se4x as a form of payment is silly enough to disturb the willful suspension of disbelief.  Overall I find the book a little below average for the genre.  The attack by a devolved mental case is OK but not as well written as I would expect from this author and his disposal (he decides Giselle is the goddess because of her freckles and commits suicide) is weak overall.	2005-10-11

An exceptional book dealing with exceptionally important qustions: Where was God?  Why did God allow this to happen?  What is the Will of God? And, ultimately, if God is in control, and if He is a God of Love, why does He let bad things happen?  What kind of God could let these things happen?  This book not only addresses but answers those eternal questions.  Weatherhead makes sense of the seemingly senseless.  <br /> <br />Written in World War II, another time in which God's will was being brought into question, an example used in the book is somewhat dated in its attitude toward women, but one example set in a specific time period,should not detract from the book's oveall thrust: The Will of God in our lives. What is it? Where is it (He) when bad things hapen? This book makes sense of it all. Read it. You will understand as never before...	2005-10-11

It has something for any singer -- and it integrates the ideas well.  It is mostly thought-evoking and it also has practical exercises.  It is very readable too.<br /><br />If you are not a singer -- you should still read this book -- it's also about life, expressing yourself, speaking, dancing, and simply \\"being\\" in a practical and thoughtful way.<br /><br />I'm personally not a fan of new-agey books, but I found the spiritual approach in this book to be very palatable to my overly-intellectual mind.<br /><br />I'd recommend this as a nice gift too.	2005-10-11

I needed to fill some time while waiting to adopt our daughter in China. Although I did plow through this book I have to admit unless I was actually studying a certain demographic or had an academic interest in China and their \\"one child\\" policy I think it would be a somewhat \\"dry\\" read. Now, if you are intrested in the politics and culture, as well as the present, past and future reguarding the population and child bearing policy as well as domestic and international adoption; the book could be a good resourse. I have found it educational and indeed an asset in having a background on why my future daughter was given up by her birth parents in China and for answering the slew of questions I will be asked upon her arrival as I am sure many people in our community will have. This book is very helpful if you have ever wanted to know \\"WHY\\".	2005-10-11

The recommendations and cooking times suggested are competely outdated.  <br /> <br />For example, it suggests to freeze baby food for up to a year. Baby food begins to loose vitamins after a month in the  <br />freezer.  <br /> <br />Another example is that is recommends the one cooks the fruits and vegetables for 10-30 min. This completely depletes the vitamins of the food. What is the point of making the baby food then??? <br /> <br />It suggests introduction of certain vegetables and fruits that are considered highly allergenic at an early age/month. This only increases the risk of allergies for your baby. <br /> <br />It never warns parents of nitrates in carrots, beets, turnips etc. So any person reading this book would feed a 5 or 6 months old carrots cooked at home and would be feeding her baby nitrates. Current research shows that babies can only process nitrates at 8 months or older. <br /> <br />This books needs some serious updating! <br /> <br />A much better book is Mommy Made and Daddy Too!

US	35771631	R16QQKFSXNAOAM	0929605489	194244729	Captain Salt in Oz	Books	3	1	3	N	Y	Not much Oz	L. Frank Baum set a precedent early on for having Oz stories that take place mostly outside of Oz. Even so, they always wound up back in the famous fairyland at some point. This volume doesn't even do that. Oz appears only at the periphery. <br /> <br />The story brings back some of Thompson's characters from a previous volume. Captain Salt has been designated as the royal explorer of Oz and he stops of to pick up King Ato of the Octagon Isle to serve as his cook as he goes off exploring. Roger the Read Bird also has to come along to keep things stirred up. The crew sets off on a voyage of discovery and, of course, adventure. Oz only appears as the imperial power claiming the new lands. <br /> <br />Early on, the explorers pick up a young prince being held captive by savages and his guardian hippo. The young prince turns out to be the king of another fairyland on a legendary continent and the crew sets out to restore him against the wishes of the usurpers. <br /> <br />Thompson usually does well with her own characters as opposed to using Baum's. That is marginally the case with this book as well but it does not read as well as most of her others. It is a fair story but nothing to get overly excited about. <br />	2005-10-11

And shame on the editors!  <br /> <br />A mediocre short story at best.  <br /> <br />There was enough repeating drivel in this book to earn syndication royalties. <br /> <br />For all the endless blabbering the narrator does about his wife, we are told next to nothing about her. \\"I have no family\\", she says, and that's it....247 pages, that's inexcusable.  <br />Most importantly for me, the preacher himself was mind numbingly boring, bland and indecisive.  To what good is this preacher as an example, if he is so overwrought with selfdoubt? <br /> <br />At 77 years old, if this is the \\"life/legacy letter\\" this preacher feels so compelled to leave to his young son then someone should phone the child protection agency.

Besides one's understanding of the world, Smith uses the word \\"worldview\\" to signify a \\"way of life,\\" \\"the story of the world\\" and of God's people, \\"aesthetics,\\" \\"religious sensibility,\\" and \\"attitude on life\\" (xiii). Thus, for Smith, the doctrine of the Trinity is not just a doctrine; it is a truth that encompasses all aspects of reality. <br /> <br />Smith begins by outlining the basics of the biblical teaching of the Trinity. Perhaps more than any other doctrine, the Trinity is universally affirmed by all branches of Christ's church. Thus, this book may be profitably read by Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant Christians. Smith states that the Trinity may be established from Scripture by proving the following five propositions: \\"there is one God; the Father is God; the Son is God; the Spirit is God; and the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinguishable persons in relationship with one another\\" (3). The doctrine of the Trinity must be discovered in Scripture and believed by faith rather than arrived at by reason. Scripture, therefore, is the key. \\"God's revelation in His Word is our ultimate standard for judging all that we know and learn, while it presupposes that God is revealing Himself in every thing that He created and in the process of history as well\\" (14). <br /> <br />Based upon his brief introduction to the biblical basis of the Trinity, Smith spends the rest of book exploring its implications in every realm of truth. Though the doctrine of the Trinity may seem difficult or even contradictory, \\"truth is an entirely rational and perfect system, for God cannot contradict Himself\\" (17). God as Trinity is a personal God, interacting in fellowship within Himself. Christianity is the only religion whose God is not only absolute but also personal. Thus, God Himself is the ground of all personal virtues like righteousness, faithfulness, and goodness. For instance, \\"righteousness for the triune God means that each of the persons respects and preserves the boundaries of the others\\" (19). <br /> <br />Probably the best portion of Smith's book is in Chapters 3, in which he explores the truth that \\"what God does in history reveals who He is in eternity\\" (31). The nature of God is the foundation of all earthly relationships. In God, the essence or bond of the relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is love. \\"God's covenant love for His people reflects something deeper and more wonderful: the eternal self-denying love that each of the Persons of the Trinity has for the others\\" (38). Men who live in a covenant relationship with God indwell within God and God within them. \\"God in His saving grace brings His people into that same covenantal love that is shared by the Persons of the Trinity\\" (45). Also, highly significant in this regard is Smith's work on the essence of a worldview, which I would categorize into metaphysics (transcendence), priority (hierarchy), ethics (commandments), epistemology (sanctions), and teleology (succession). <br /> <br />Throughout the rest of the book Smith discusses many issues that may be traced directly to one's worldview. He demonstrates the superiority of the Christian view of the origin of the world over the Big Bang theory. His view of Christian cosmogony is essentially covenantal. \\"The covenantal meaning of the world, then, is that the world is the love gift of the Father through the Spirit to the Son. It is an expression of the covenantal fellowship of love in the Trinity, an aspect of their mutual enjoyment of one another\\" (58). This understanding also establishes a symbolic view of reality. Furthermore, Smith discusses God's purpose for creation, His revelation of Himself to creation, and God's work in history-including the \\"problem\\" of evil, miracles, the incarnation, the gospel, the kingdom of God, and the great commission. Each of these issues is properly understood only within a Christian, Trinitarian world. <br /> <br />Smith continues by describing the significance of the Trinity to an individual's role in society. He answers questions that concern the relationship between an individual and the society in which he lives. He states, \\"our self-who we are-is determined by our relationships, just as the three Persons of the Trinity are who they are in their mutual relationships\\" (163). He speaks of the covenantal institutions that God has established in the family, the church, and the state. To end, Smith deals with the issues concerning eternity: hell, heaven, and eschatology. Only as the Christian understands these topics in relation to the Trinity can he adequately live consistently with the biblical teaching. Our understanding of who God is and our relationship with God as Father, Son, and Spirit guide us in our expectation of heaven and the end of time. \\"The enjoyment of God includes the enjoyment of all the things He created and of every gift He gives. ... Every biblical expression that points to the fullness of our salvation leads us to contemplate the greatness and wonder of God Himself. In order for us to enjoy and glorify Him as we should, Paul tells us that we will be made like Him\\" (201). <br /> <br />Without a doubt this book is foundational to a completely and distinctively biblical worldview. Especially for those who are not yet familiar with thinking in presuppositional or worldview terms, Trinity & Reality demonstrates that everything a Christian knows and does finds its source in our God. Highly recommended for Christians from all traditions!	2005-10-11

It takes you through his psychological developement as a child to the developement of his sexual identity and ties it all in with his drive as an artist and as an alchemist. Unlike other books on his life or work, this one fuses all the elements together: psychology, alchemy, art, the occult and sex.
